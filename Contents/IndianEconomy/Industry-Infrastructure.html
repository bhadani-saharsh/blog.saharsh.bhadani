	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			India has to enhance its infrastructure to reach its 2025 economic growth target of US$ 5 trillion.
		</li>
		<li>
			India's population growth and economic development require improved transport infrastructure, 
			including investments in roads, railways, and aviation, shipping and inland waterways.
		</li>
		<li>
			Development of infrastructure has a multiplier effect on demand and efficiency of transport and 
			increases commercial and entrepreneurship opportunities.
		</li>
		<li>
			In June 2022, the Minister of Road Transport and Highways, opened 15 national highway projects 
			worth Rs. 13,585 crores (US$1.7 billion) in Patna and Hajipur, Bihar.
		</li>
		<li>
			In October 2021, the Dubai government and India signed a contract in October 2021 to build 
			infrastructure in Jammu and Kashmir, including industrial parks, IT towers, multipurpose towers, 
			logistics centres, medical colleges, and specialized hospitals.
		</li>
		<li>
			Budget 2023-24 is complemented with the continuation of the 50-year interest-free loan to state 
			governments for one more year to spur investment in infrastructure and to incentivize them for 
			complementary policy actions, with a significantly enhanced outlay of ₹ 1.3 lakh crore (US$ 16 
			billion).
		</li>
		<li>
			Under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), projects worth Rs. 108 trillion (US$ 1.3 trillion) 
			are currently at different stages of implementation
		</li>
		<li>
			In November 2022, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) is set up as a collaborative 
			investment platform between the Government of India, global investors, multilateral development 
			banks (MDB) and domestic financial institutions to facilitate investment across multiple sectors in 
			India through an India Japan Fund.
		</li>
		<li>
			Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Budget for 2023-24 underlines sustained focus on the northeast 
			for "inclusive development" as one of the seven priorities, which act as the 'Saptarishi' guiding 
			the government "through the Amrit Kaal".
		</li>
		<li>
			Under Budget 2023-24, capital investment outlay for infrastructure is being increased by 33% to 
			Rs.10 lakh crore (US$ 122 billion), which would be 3.3 per cent of GDP and almost three times the 
			outlay in 2019-20.
		</li>
		<li>
			Under Budget 2023-24, Infrastructure Finance Secretariat is being established to enhance 
			opportunities for private investment in infrastructure that will assist all stakeholders for more 
			private investment in infrastructure, including railways, roads, urban infrastructure, and power.
		</li>
		<li>
			The "Smart Cities Mission" and "Housing for All" programmes have benefited from these initiatives. 
			Saudi Arabia seeks to spend up to US$ 100 billion in India in energy, petrochemicals, refinery, 
			infrastructure, agriculture, minerals, and mining.
		</li>
		<li>
			The infrastructure sector is a key driver of the Indian economy. The sector is highly responsible 
			for propelling India’s overall development and enjoys intense focus from the Government for 
			initiating policies that would ensure the time-bound creation of world-class infrastructure in the 
			country. The infrastructure sector includes power, bridges, dams, roads, and urban infrastructure 
			development. In other words, the infrastructure sector acts as a catalyst for India’s economic 
			growth as it drives the growth of the allied sectors like townships, housing, built-up 
			infrastructure, and construction development projects.
