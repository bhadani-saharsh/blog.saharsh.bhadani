	<h1>JAPANESE CANDLESTICK CHARTING TECHNIQUE</h1>
	<hr>
	<hr>
	<p>
		The term "candlesticks" also called "candles" is a Japanese chart
		analysis technique that has been refined by generations of use in
		the Far East. Until 1991, the technique remained secret from the
		Western world for over a century because no document ever mentioned
		about it. But, now it is known and accepted worldwide. Some of the
		features of this technique are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Easy to understand</li>
		<li>Provide earlier indications of the market turns and reversal
			signals</li>
		<li>Furnish unique market insights by showing the underpinning
			move</li>
		<li>Enjoyable to learn</li>
		<li>Applicable to any market be it Eastern or Western and enhances
			analysis</li>
		<li>Increases the effeciency of analysis by sending visual
			information</li>
		<li>Based on psychology of market - considers sentiments of
			traders</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>The basics of candlesticks</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Candle - </b>A candle has a real body which is the rectangular 
		section and thin lines above and below the real body called shadows. 
		The top and the bottom sections of the rectangular body represent 
		the open and the close values and the tips of shadows represent 
		the high and the low values. Because of their shape these are 
		called candles. Candles can be drawn using any time frame- from 
		intraday to daily to weekly charts and so on. Multiple variants 
		of candle are shown below:
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 25%;">
				<p>
					<b> The white candle - </b> when the close value is greater 
					the open value then this is depicted as a white candle.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is also called bulls.

			<td style="width: 25%;">
				<p>
					<b> The black candle - </b> when the open value is greater 
					the close value then this is depicted as a black candle.
				</p>

					This is also called bears.

	</table>
	<p>
		<b>Shaven head- </b>If a candle has no upper shadow, it is said 
		to have shaven head. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Shaven bottom- </b>A candle with no lower shadow has a shaven 
		bottom. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Spinning top- </b>The japanese term for a small real body 
		(black or white) is a spinning top.
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<b>Doji- </b>When there are no real body i.e. when the 
				open and close values are really close then the candles 
				representing these are called doji. Doji have implications 
				as a reversal signal.

	<h2>Trend reversal</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<p>
					Trend reversal means that the prior trend is about to
					end. This is shown in the figure on the right side of 
					this section. The indicators have indicated that the upward
					movement is about to end. And now one of the three situation
					may happen:
					<ul>
						<li>
							The price will continue to move up a bit and then it 
							will move down.
						</li>
						<li>
							The price will move down and after reaching a point, it 
							will rise again.
						</li>
						<li>
							The price will fall and continue to fall.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Trend reversal is just a caution indicator. The market's
					psychology is in transformation. The same is applicable for downtrend as well.

	<h2>UMBRELLA LINES</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Candles with long lower shadows and small real bodies 
						(black or white) near the top of the range. These are 
						called umbrella lines because they look like umbrellas.
					</li>
					<li>
						These umbrella lines can be either bullish or bearish 
						according to the market environment. <u>The character of 
						umbrella lines chnages based on the prevailing trend before 
						the umbrella lines</u>.
					</li>
					<li>
						If an umbrella line emerges during a downtrend, it is 
						a signal that the downtrend should end. In such a scenario, 
						this umbrella line is labeled a <b>hammer</b>, as in "the 
						market is hammering out" a base.
					</li>
					<li>
						The actual Japanese word for the hammer is <b>takuri</b>.
						The hammer line looks like a hammer with its head and handle.
						The hammer's long lower shadow and the close at, or near, the 
						high of the session graphically relays that the market sold off 
						sharply during the session and then bounced back to close at, or 
						near, the session's high. this could have bullsih ramifications. 
						This aspect of closing at or near highs is why the hammer should 
						have no, or a miniscule, upper shodow. If there was a long upper 
						shadow, this would mean the market closed well off its highs, 
						which is an important criterion for the hammer. A lower shadow 
						is necessary because it would display that the market had been 
						pushed downsharply lower during the session, but by the end 
						of the session, there was a "kamikaze fight" as the bears lost 
						controls is depicted by the fact that the market closed at, or near, 
						its session highs.
					</li>
					<li>
						If either of lines emerges after a rally, it is a potential 
						top reversal signal called <b>a hanging man</b>. The name 
						"hanging man" is derived from the fact that it looks like a 
						hanging man with dangling legs. It has the same shape as the 
						hammer. The only difference is that a hanging man comes after 
						an advance. A close beneath the hanging man is preffered. 
						<u>It is advisable to wait for bearish confirmation after 
							a hanging man.</u>
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>The colour of the the real body does not make any difference.</u>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The hammer and hanging man can be recognized by three 
					criteria:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The real body is at the upper end of the trading range.
						The colour of the real body is not important.
					</li>
					<li>
						It has a long lower shadow that should be at least twice 
						the height of the real body.
					</li>
					<li>
						It should have no, or a very short, upper shadow.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p> 
					There are three aspects that differentiate the hanging man 
					from hammer- trend, extent of the move before the candle line,
					and the confirmation.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Trend: </b>A hammer must come after a decline. A hanging man
						must come after a rally.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Extent of the move before the candle line: </b>A hammer is valid
						even if it comes after a short-term decline, but a hanging man should
						emerge after an extended rally, preferably at an all-time high.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Confirmation: </b>A hanging man should be confirmed, while a 
						hammer need not be.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The longer the lower shadow, the shorter the upper shadow; the 
					smaller the real body, the more meaningful the bullish hammer or 
					bearish hanging man.

	<h2>THE ENGULFING PATTERN</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Most candle signals are based on combinations of 
						individual candle lines. The engulfing pattern is 
						the first of these multiple candle line patterns.
					</li>
					<li>
						The engulfing pattern is a major reversal signal 
						with two opposite colour real bodies composing a 
						pattern.
					</li>
					<li>
						Another name for the engulfing pattern is a "hugging 
						line".
					</li>
					<li>
						The figure shown on the right (above) of this section 
						shows <b>a bullish	englufing pattern</b>. The market 
						is falling. And then a white bullish real body wraps 
						around, or engulfs, the prior period's black real body. 
						This shows buying pressure has over-whelmed selling 
						pressure.
					</li>
					<li>
						The figure shown on the right (below) of this section 
						shows <b>a bearish engulfing pattern</b>. Here the 
						market is trending higher. A white real body engulfed 
						by a black real body is the signal for a top reversal. 
						This also shows that supply has overwhelmed demand.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ol>
					There are three criteria for an engulfing pattern:
					<li>
						The market has to be in a clearly definable uptrend 
						(for a bearish engulfing pattern) or downtrend (for
						a bullish englufing pattern), even if the trend is 
						short term.
					</li>
					<li>
						Two candles comprise the engulfing pattern. The second 
						real body must engulf the prior real body (it need not 
						engluf the shadows).
					</li>
					<li>
						The second real body of the engulfing pattern should be 
						the opposite colour of the first real body. The exception 
						to this rule is if the first real body of the engulfing 
						pattern is a doji. Thus, after an extended fall, a doji 
						engulfed by a very large white real body could be a bottom 
						reversal. In an uptrend, a doji enveloped by a very large 
						black real body could be a bearish reversal pattern.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					Some factors increasing the likelihood that an engulfing 
					pattern could be an important turning signal are:
					<li>
						If the first day of the engulfing pattern has a very small 
						real body (i.e., a spinning top) and the second day has a 
						very long real body. The small first real body candle 
						reflects a dissipation of the prior trend's force and the 
						large second real body proves an increase in the force 
						behind the new move.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the engulfing pattern appears after a protracted or very 
						fast move. A fast or extended move creates an overextended 
						market (either overbought or oversold) and makes it vulnerable 
						to profit taking.
					</li>
					<li>
						If there is heavy volume on the second real body of the 
						engulfing pattern. 
					</li>

	<h2>DARK-CLOUD COVER</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						It is a reversal pattern. It is a dual-candle pattern 
						that is a top reversal after an uptrend or, at times, 
						at the top of a congestion band.
					</li>
					<li>
						The first day of this two-candle pattern is a strong white 
						real body. The second day's price opens above the prior 
						session's high (that is, above the top of the upper shadow).
						However, by the end of the second day's session, the market 
						closes deeply within the prior day's white body. 
					</li>
					<li>
						The greater the degree of penetration into the white body, the 
						more likely this is a top. <u>Some Japanese technicians require 
						more than a 50-percent penetration of the black session's close 
					    into the white real body.</u> 
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>If the black candles does not close below the halfway point 
						of the white candlestick, it may be best to wait for more 
						bearish confirmation following the dark-cloud cover.</b> 
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>In some cases it is considered as a 
						dark-cloud cover even if the open is over the prior session's 
					    close instead of the prior session's high.</u>
					</li>
					<li>
						The rationale behind this bearish pattern is readily explained. 
						On the first session of the dark-cloud cover, the market is 
						ascending with a strong white candle. This is followed by a gap 
						higher on the next session's opening. Thus far, the bulls are in 
						complete control. But then the whole technical picture changes as, 
						on the second day of this pattern, the market closed not only 
						beneath the prior close, but well within the prior day's real body, 
						offsetting much of the gain of the first session. In such scenario, 
						the longs will have second thoughts about their position.
					</li>
					<li>
						Those who were waiting for selling short now have a benchmark to 
						place a stop <u>at the new high of the second day of the dark-cloud 
						cover pattern</u>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Just as a bearish engulfing pattern can be resistance, so too <b>the 
						highest high of the two sessions that formed the dark-cloud 
						cover should be resistance</b>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<Center>
					<img src="dark-cloud-cover.png" alt="Dark Cloud Cover">
					<p><u>Dark Cloud Cover</u></p>
				</Center>
				
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<ol>
		Some factors intensifying the importance of the dark-cloud covers include:
		<li>
			The greater the penetration of the black real body's close into the 
			prior white real body, the greater the chance for a 
			top. <u>If the black real body covers the prior day's entire white 
			body, it would be a bearish engulfing pattern rather than a dark-cloud 
			cover.</u> <b>A bearish engulfing pattern, consequently, can be a more 
			meaningful top reversal. If a long white real body closes above the highs
		    of the dark-cloud cover, or the bearish engulfing pattern it could 
		    indicate another rally</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			During a prolonged ascent, if there is a strong white day that opens 
			on its low (that is, a shaven bottom) and closes on its high (that is,
			a shaven head) and the next day reveals a long black real body day, 
			opening on its high and closing on its low, then a shaven head and 
			shaven bottom black day has occurred.
		</li>
		<li>
			If the second body (i.e., the black body) of the dark-cloud covers 
			opens above a major resistance level and then fails, it would prove 
			the bulls were unable to take control of the market.
		</li>
		<li>
			If on the opening of the second day, there is very heavy volume, 
			then a buying blow off could have occurred. For example, heavy volume 
			at a new opening high could mean that many new buyers have decided to 
			jump abroad ship. Then the market sells off. <b>For future traders, 
			very high opening interest can be another warning</b>.

	<h2>PIERCING PATTERN</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The dark-cloud cover's counterpart is the bullish piercing 
						pattern. The piercing pattern is composed of two candles in 
						a falling market.The first candle is a black real body day 
						and the second is a white real body. This white candle opens
						lower, ideally under the low of the prior black day. Then the 
						prices rebound to push well into the black candle's real body. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td style="width: 50%;">

					<p><u>Piercing pattern</u></p>
				</center>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The piercing pattern is similar to the bullish engulfing pattern.
						In the bullish engulfing pattern, the white real body engulfs the 
						entire previous black real body. For the piercing pattern, the 
						white real body pierces, but does not wrap around, the prior black 
						body. 
					</li>
					<li>
						In the piercing pattern, the greater the degree of penetration into 
						the black real body, the more likely it will become a bottom reversal. 
						An ideal piercing pattern will have a white real body that pushes more 
						than halfway into the prior session's black real body. The psychology 
						behind the piercing pattern is as follows: 
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The market is in a downtrend. The bearish black real body reinforces 
							this view.
						</li>
						<li>
							The next session the market opens lower via a gap. The bears are watching the 
							market with happiness.
						</li>
						<li>
							Then the market surges toward the close, managing not only to close unchanged 
							from the prior day's close, but sharply above that close. The bears will be 
							second-guessing their position.
						</li>
						<li>
							Those who are looking to buy would say new lows could not hold and could view 
							it as an opportunity to buy.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>
						The piercing pattern signal increases in importance based on the same factors 
						1 through 4 as with the dark-cloud cover, but in reverse.
					</li>
					<li>
						With the dark-cover we would like to see the black real body closing more than 
						midway in the prior white candlestick. But there is some flexibility to this rule.
						There is less flexibility with the piercing pattern. The piercing pattern's white 
						candlestick should push more than halfway into the black candlestick's real body.
					</li>
					<li>
						The reason for less latitude with the bullish piercing pattern than with the bearish 
						dark-cloud cover pattern is the fact that the Japanese have three other patterns 
						called <i>the on-neck, the in-neck, and the thrusting pattern</i>. 
					</li>
					<li>
						All three have same basic formation as the piercing pattern. The difference among them 
						is in the degree of penetration by the white candle into the black candle's real body.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>The on-neck pattern- </b>The on-neck pattern's white candle (usually a small one) 
						closes near the low of the previous session.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>The in-neck pattern- </b> The in-neck pattern's white candle closes slightly into 
						the prior real body (it should also be a small white candle).
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>The thrusting pattern- </b>The thrusting pattern should be a longer white candle that 
						is stronger than the in-neck pattern, but still does not close above the middle of the 
						prior black body.
					</li>
					<li>
						The general concept that one should view a non-ideal candle pattern by:
						<ol>
							<li>
								How it was formed
							</li>
							<li>
								Within the overall market picture
							</li>
						</ol>
						These two factors will help us gauge if the less-than-perfect pattern could have 
						the same implications as a more classicly defined candle pattern. It is the 
						subjectivity that makes computer recognition of candle patterns so difficult.

				<ul>
					<li>
						A star is a small real body (white or black) that 
						gaps away from the large real body preceeding it.
					</li>
					<li>
						In other words, the star's real body can be within 
						the prior session's upper shadow. All that is needed 
						is that the real bodies don't operlap (there are some 
						exceptions to this rule, which are addressed later in 
						this section).

						a signal of a shift from buyers being in control to a

	<h2>THE MORNING STAR</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The morning star is a bottom reversal pattern. Its 
						name is derived because, like the morning star (the 
						nickname for the planet Mercury) that foretells the 
						sunrise, it indicates higher prices. There are three 
						candle lines comprising this pattern:
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Candle 1</b>: An <b>extended black real body</b>. This pictorially 
							proves that the bears are in command.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Candle 2</b>: A <b>small real body that doesn't touch the prior 
							real body</b> (these two lines comprise a basic star pattern). 
							The small real body means sellers are losing the capacity 
							to drive the market lower.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Candle 3</b>: The concluding candle of the morning star is a <b>white 
							real body that intrudes deeply into the first session's black 
							candle</b>. This is the indication that the bulls have seized control.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>
						<b>The lowest low of the three lines that form this pattern 
						should be support</b> as hown by the dashed line.
					</li>
					<li>
						An ideal morning star would have a gap between the second 
						and the third bodies. Although, a lack of gap does not seem

					<li>
						The evening star is the bearish counterpart of the morning star 
						pattern. It is named so because the evening star (the nickname 
						for the planet Venus) appears just before darkness sets in. Since 
						the evening star is a top reversal, it should be acted upon if it 
						arises after an uptrend.
					</li>
					<li>
						Three lines compose the evening star:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The first is a long white body.
							</li>
							<li>
								The next is a star. The star is the first hint of a top.
							</li>
							<li>
								The third line corroborates a top and completes the three-line 
								pattern of the evening star.The third line is a black body that 
								closes sharply into the first period's white real body.
							</li>
							<li>
								Evening star pattern is analogous to a traffic light. The traffic 
								light goes from green (the bullish white body) to yellow (the star's 
								warning signal) to red (the black real body confirming the prior trend 
								has stopped).
							</li>
							<li>
								An evening star should have a gap between the first and the second real bodies 
								and then another gap between the second and the third real bodies. But, this 
								second gap is rarely seen and is not necessary for the success of this pattern. 
								The main concern should be the extent of the intrusion of the third day's black 
								real body into the first day's white body.
							</li>
							<li>
								Some factors increasing the likelihood that an evening or morning star could be 
								a reversal would include:
								<ol>
									<li>
										If there is no overlap among the first, second, and the third real bodies.
									</li>
									<li>
										If the third candle closes deeply into the first candle's real body.
									</li>
									<li>
										If there is light volume on the first candle session and heavy volume on 
										the third candle session. This would show a reduction of the force for 
										the prior trend and an increase in the direction force of the new trend.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								The highs of the evening star become resistance as displayed by the dashed line.

					</li>
					<li>
						Since it is one session, it is usually not a major reversal signal as

					</li>
					<li>
						The shooting star is a bearish reversal signal, it must come after a rally.
						An ideal shooting star has a real body that gaps away from the prior real 
						body. Nonetheless, as will be seen in several chart examples, this gap is not 
						always necessary. A lack of rising gap is more of a reason to be negative on 
						the shooting star. The trend could be turning less bullish if the shooting

			the required bullish verification of the inverted hammer is because its long upper shadow gives 
			the inverted hammer a bearish hue. To be aware of the inverted hammer session, the market opens on,

						Spinning tops (that is, small real bodies) are components in certain formations. The 
						harami is one of these formations (the star, examined in chapter 5, in another).The 
						harami pattern is a small real body that is contained within what the Japanese call 
						"an unusually long black or white real body."
					</li>
					<li>
						"Harami" is an old Japanese word for pregnant. The Japanese nickname for the long 
						candle is the "mother" candle and the small is the "baby" or "fetus". The second 
						candle of the harami can be white or black. If, for example, both the first and 
						second candles of the harami are white, it would be expressed as "white-white harami".
					</li>
					<li>
						The Japanese will say that with a harami the market is "loosing its breadth". The 
						bearish harami displays a disparity about the market's health. Specifically after 
						a bull move, the long white real body's vitality is followed by the small real body's 
						uncertainity. Additionally, the small real body opening and closing within the prior 
						open-close range is another indication that the bulls' upward drive has weekened. Thus, 
						a trend reversal is possible.

			During a bear move, the selling force reflected by a long black real body is followed by the 
			second day's inability to decide actions. This could be a sign that a possibility of trend 
			reversal since the second day's small real body is an alert that the bears' power has dimished.
			The combination of candle lines in the harami pattern, with its first tall real body followed 
			by a small real body, is the reverse of the engulfing pattern. In the engulfing pattern, a 
			lengthy real body engulfs the preceding small real body. Another difference between the harami 
			and engulfing pattern is that for the two candles of the engulfing pattern, the colour of the 
			real bodies should be opposite. This is not necessary for the harami. However, in most instances, 
			the real bodies in the harami pattern are oppositely coloured. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The entire range of the second session may not be within range of the first session. For harami 
			all that is required is that the second real body be within the first real body, even if the 
			shadow of the second day is above or below the prior day's high and low. In the figure (left side) 
			shown in this section, on the second sessio the upper shadow moved over the prior white real body. 
			This is still a harami because the second session's real body was contained within the first real

						principle, the more diminutive the second real body, the more potent the pattern. This is usually true 
						because the smaller the real body, the greater the ambivalence and the more likely a trend reversal. In 
						the extremes, as the real body becomes smaller as the spread between the open and close narrows, a doji 
						is formed. doji preceded by a long blackreal body during a decline (or a tall white real body during a rally)
						is distinctive type of harami reffered to as a harami cross.
					</li>
					<li>
						The harami cross, becasue it contains a doji, is viewed as a strong reversal signal than the regular 
						harami pattern by the Japanese. The harami cross is sometimes referred to as the petrifying pattern. 
						The best way to justify this name is that the preceeding trend has been frozen or petrified in 
						preparation for a reverse move. A harami cross occuring after a very long white candle is a pattern 
						a long trader ignores at his or her own peril. Harami cross can also call bottoms, but they seem more

						Tweezers are two or more candle lines with matching highs or lows. They are called tweezers tops and

						bottom is made when two or more successive lows are the same. The tweezers could be composed of real 
						bodies, shadows, and/or doji. Ideally the tweezers should have a long first candle and a small real 
						body as the next session. This shows that whatever force the market had on the first session (bullish 
						force with a long white candle and bearish force with a long black candle), it was dissolving with the 
						following small real body with the same high (for a tweezers top) or same low (top a tweezers bottom). 
						If there is a bearish (for a top reversal) or a bullish (for a bottom reversal) candle signal that is 
						also a tweezers top, it adds more importance to the pattern.

						The bearish belt-hold is a long black candle that opens on the high of the session (on within a few ticks

						black real body's open. It then closes under the first black candle's close.

							</li>
							<li>
								The new highs fail to hold and the market forms a black candle.

						a star) or it can be, as Japanese express it, "riding on the shoulder" of the long white body (i.e., be at the upper end 
						of the prior long white real body). The small real body discloses a deterioration of the bulls' power.
					</li>
					<li>
						Although the advance block and stalled patterns are not normally top reversal patterns, they can sometimes precede a 
						price decline.The advance block and stalled patterns should be used to liquidate or protect longs, but usually not to 
						short. They are generally more consequential at higher price levels. <u>These patterns can be at low price area or 
						during a rally</u>.
					</li>
					<li>
						There is not much difference between the advanced block and stalled pattern. The main factor to consider with three 
						white soliders is that it is most constructive for each of the three candles to close at or near its highs. If the 
						latter two white candles shows signs of hesitation, either with small real bodies or uppper shadows, then it is a 
						clue that the rally is losing force.
					</li>

						It id found that on corrections, the first or second white candle that started hte three white soliders is often

					<li>
						There is a group of longer-term topping and bottoming pattern that include the three moauntain, three rivers, the three 
						Buddha tops, inverted three Buddha, dumpling tops, fry-pan bottoms, and tower tops and bottoms.
					</li>
					<li>
						Three mountain top is supposed to represent a major top. If the market backs off from a high three times or makes three 
						attempts at a high, it is deemed a three mountain top. The high point of the final mountain ideally should be confirmed 
						with a bearish candle indicator (for example, a doji or dark-cloud cover). If the central mountain of a three mountain 
						top is the highest mountain, it is a special type of three mountain called a three Buddha top. The reason for this name 
						is because, in Buddhist temples, there is a large central Buddha with smaller Buddhas (i.e., saints) on both sides. This 
						is the same pattern as the West's head and shoulders top. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Although the three Buddha top is analogous to the Western head and shoulders pattern, the theory about the japanese three 
						Buddha pattern was used over a hundred years before the head and shoulders was known in America. (The earliest reference 
						seen to a head and shoulders pattern in the United States was by Richard Schabaker in the 1930s).
					</li>
					<li>
						It is intriguing how market observers from both the West and the East have come up with this same pattern. Market 
						psychology is the same around the world, or, as a Japanese proverb expresses, "The tone of a bird's song is the same
						everywhere".
					</li>
					<li>
						The three river bottom pattern is the opposite of the three mountain top. This occurs when the market tests a bottom level 
						three times. The peak of the troughs should be exceeded to confirm a bottom. The equivalent of the Western inverted head 
						and shoulders bottom is called, not surprisingly, an inverted three Buddha.
					</li>
					<li>
						The peaks of each mountain were almost the same. This is not necessary. It is still considered a three mountain top if 
						the three price peaks are not exactly at the same highs. If A, B, and C are three peaks where B and C are slightly higher 
						levels. This would still be considered a three mountain top.

	<h2>COUNTERATTACK LINES</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Counterattack lines are formed when opposite coloured candles have the same close. The best way to describe this pattern is 
						by discussing the illustrations on the right-side of this section. The figure above is an example of a bullish counterattack 
						line. This pattern occurs during a decline. The first candle of this pattern is usually a long black candle. The next session 
						opens sharply lower. At this point, the bears are feeling confident. The bulls then stage their counterattack as they push 
						prices back up to unchanged from the prior close. The prior downtrend has then been suspended.
					</li>
					<li>
						The bullish counterattack is comparable to the bullish piercing line. If you remember, the piercing line has the same 
						two-candle configuration as that shown for the bullish counterattack pattern. The main differnece is that the bullish 
						counterattack line does not move into the prior session's white real body. It just gets back to the prior session's 
						close. The piercing pattern's second line pushes well into the black real body. Consequently, the piercing pattern is 
						a more significant bottom reversal than is the bullish counterattack line. Nonetheless, as shown in same examples below, 
						the bullish counterattack line should be respected, since it proves that there is a change in the flow of direction of 
						the market.
					</li>
					<li>
						The figure below is the bullish counterattack line is the bearish counterattack line. The first candle, a long white one, 
						keeps the bullish momentum going. The next session's opening gaps higher. The longs are happy then the bears come out 
						fighting and pull prices to the prior day's close. The bulls' tide of optimism on the second day's opening probably turned 
						to apprehension by the close. As the bullish counterattack line is rlated to the piercing line, so the bearish counterattack 
						line is related to the dark-cloud cover. The bearish counterattack line is realted to the dark-cloud cover. The bearish 
						counteratack, like the dark-cloud cover, should ideally open above the prior day's high. Unlike the dark-cloud cover, though, 
						the close does not go into the prior day's white candle. Thus, the dark-cloud cover sends a stronger top reversal signal than 
						does the bearish counterattack line.
					</li>
					<li>
						An important consideration of the counterattack lines is that second session should open robustly higher (in the case of the 
						bearish counterattack) or sharply lower (for the bullish counterattack). The idea is that on the opening of the second day of 
						this pattern, the market has moved slightly in the direction of the original trend. Then, by the close, it moves back to unchanged 
						from the prior session. In doing so, it changes the market's texture in one day.
					</li>
					<li>
						A mentioned in the secion of three black crows, becasue we need to wait for three black candles for the completion of 
						that signal, much of the move may be lost bt the time the third candle of the three black crows unfolds. In this case, 
						however, eith the first black candle's counterattack line, we would have received an early tirning signal in one session 
						that was further confirmed with the three black crows.

						terminology.)
					</li>
					<li>
						The market is ascending with higher highs and goes into a period where the highs are the same, and then goes to lower highs.

						The frypan bottom reflects a market that is bottoming and whose price action forms a concave design and then opens a gap to

						more proof that the bears have lost control of the market. The Japanese will say that with a frypan bottom the parket becomes 
						"immune to bad news". As such, if a market builds a frypan bottom- especially in spite of bearish news- it would be very 
						impressive.

	<h2>CONTINUATION PATTERNS</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Most candle signals are trend reversals. There are , however, a group of candle patterns that are continuation indicators. A continuation 
			pattern is one in which the market should continue the same trend as that in force before the continuation pattern. For instance, a continuation 
			pattern following a rally means that the trend remains up and we should expect the rally to remain in force. (This, however, does not preclude a 
			correction after the continuation pattern before the rally, hopefully, unfolds.)
		</li>
		<li>
			As the Japanese express it, "Thre are time to buy, times to sell, and times to rest". Many of these continuation patterns imply a time to
			rest, a breather, before the market resumes its prior trend. The continuation formations reviewed in this chapter are windows (and patterns
			that include windows), the rising and falling three methods, separating lines, and three white soliders.
		</li>

	<h2>WINDOWS</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Japanese refer to what we call in the West a gap as a window. Whereas the Western expression is "filling in the gap",
						the Japanese would say, "closing the window". There are two kinds of windows, one bullish and other bearish.
					</li>
					<li>
						A rising window is a bullish signal. There is a price vacuum between the prior session's high (that is, the top of the upper 
						shadow) and the current session's low (e.g., the bottom of the lower shadow).
					</li>
					<li>
						It is said by the Japanese technicians to "go in the dirrection of the window". This is because windows are continuation signals.
						Consequently, <b>with the emergence of a rising window, one should look to buy on dips, and with a falling window to sell on bounces</b>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>It is also said by the Japanese that "corrections stop at the window". This means windows can become support and resistance 
						areas. Thus, a rising window (the entire window) should also be a zone of support on pullbacks. If the pullback closes under the 
						bottom of the window, the prior uptrend is voided</u>. In the rising window figure, the market got under the bottom of the window, 
						but since it didn't close under this area, the rising windows support remains intact.
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>
							The entire rising window becomes a potential support zone. The disadvantage with a large window is that the whole zone 
							is potential support. Consequently, we don't have so tight a support (with a rising window) or resistance (with a falling 
							window) as one would have with a very small window.
						</u>
					</li>
					<li>
						If there are two windows. Window 1 and window 2, window 2 being at higher price levels. After window 2 is breached, the 
						window 1 becomes support. If a window support is broken, look for another window under the one that was broken as next 
						support area.

				<ul>
					<li>
						Falling window is a bearish signal in which there is a gap between the prior sesion's low and the current session's high.
					</li>
					<li>
						Likewise, a falling window implies still lower levels. Any price rebounds should run into resistance at this falling 
						window (the entire window). If the bulls have enough force to close the market above the top of the falling window, the
						downtrend is done.
					</li>
					<li>
						There is a belief in the West that a gap is always filled. But as we have seen that corrections stop at a window, once 
						prices try to fill a gap we can then consider buying (in a rising window) or selling (in a falling window).
					</li>
					<li>
						There is a common misunderstanding with windows that the real bodies don't touch. In case the shadows overlap, it is not a 
						window. So, no overlap between shadows is the main criteria for window. No matter how large the "gap" between the real bodies, 
						it is not a window unless there is a space between the shadows.
					</li>
					<li>
						No matter how tiny a rising window, that window should be potential support. The same is true with a falling window as 
						resistance.
					</li>
					<li>
						Size doesn't matter with windows. Although the rising window's support zone before bouncing. Therefore, if you are 
						aggressively bullish as a market approaches the rising window, you can consider buying as a market approaches the rising 
						window, you can consider buying even if it gets close to the top of the window. How one uses a window is dependent on 
						trading style and aggressiveness. There should be a stop (mental or otherwise) if the market clsoes under the bottom of 
						the rising window.

						Likewise, a bear trend remains in effect after the bearish falling three methods.
					</li>
					<li>
						The rising three methods is composed of:
						<ol>
							<li>
								A long white candle.
							</li>
							<li>
								The white candle is followed by a group of falling or lateral small real body candles. The ideal number of small 
								candles is three but two or more than three are also acceptable if they hold within the long white candle's high-low 
								range. Think of the small candles as forming a pattern similar to a three-day harami pattern since they hold within 
								the first session's range. (For this pattern, that would include holding within the shadows; for a true harami they 
								would have to hold with the real body.) The small candles can be either colour, but black is most ideal for this pattern.
							</li>
							<li>
								The final day should be a strong white real body session with a close above the first day's close. The final candle 
								line should ideally also open above the close of the previous session.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						This patttern resembles the Western bull flag or pennant formation. Yet the concept behind the rising three methods is from

						market is, with the group of small candles, "taking a breather".

						The ideal rising three methods has three small black real bodies within the entire trading range of a white real body.

						The challange we have with the rising three methods is from a risk / reward aspect. By the time the rising three methods 
						is completed, a stock might be far from its most recent lows. In such a secnario, buying on the completion of the three 
						methods may not offer an attractive trade. As such, one should think of the potential profit once the rising three methods 
						is completed compared to its risk (the risk being low of the white candle that stated the rising three methods).

	<h2>THE MAGIC DOJI</h2>
	<center>

	</center>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The doji is a significant reversal indicator. The doji is a distinct trend change signal, especially during rallies. The likelihood 
			of a reversal with the emergence of a doji increses if:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Subsequent candles confirm the doji's reversal potential.
				</li>
				<li>
					The market is overbought or oversold.
				</li>
				<li>
					The market doesn't have many doji. If there are numerous doji on a particular chart, one should not view the emergence of a new doji 
					as a meaningful development.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			The ideal doji sesssion has the same opening and closing price, yet there is some flexibility to this rule. If the opening and closing prices 
			are within a few ticks of each other (for example, a few cents in stocks or a few thirty-seconds in bonds, and so on), the line could still 
			be viewed as a doji.
		</li>
		<li>
			To decide whether a near-doji day (that is, where the open and close are very close, but not exact) should be considered a doji or not should 
			be based on:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Compare a near-doji in relation to recent action. If there were a series of very small real bodies, the near-doji day would not 
					be viewed as significant since so many other recent periods had small real bodies. If, however, a doji like session emerges among 
					tall candles, then we can say that such a session could have the same implications as a doji since this session is displaying 
					there is something very different on that session from the preceding action.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the market is at an important market junction.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the market is extremely overbought or oversold.
				</li>
				<li>
					If there are other technical signals sending out an alert.
				</li>
			</ol> 
		</li>
		<li>
			Since a doji can be a significant warning, it is better to attend to a false warning than to ignore a real one.
		</li>
		<li>
			Doji are valued for their ability to call market tops. This is especially true after a long white candle in an uptrend.
		</li>
		<li>
			The reason for the doji's potential negative implications in uptrends is because a doji represents indecision. Indecision, uncertainty, 
			or vacillation by buyers will not maintain a rally. It takes the conviction of buyers to sustain a rally. If the market has had an extended 
			rally, and / or is overbought, and then a doji surfaces, it could mean the scaffolding of buyers' support will give way.
		</li>
		<li>
			A caveat, from my experience, is that as successful as doji are at calling tops, they tend to lose some reversal potential in downtrends. 
			The reason may be that a doji reflects a balance between buying and selling forces. With ambivalent market participants, the market could 
			fall, as the market saying goes, "fall of its own weight". This is similar to the idea that strong volume is more important to confirm 
			an upside breakout than volume confirmation for a downside breakout.
		</li>
		<li>
			Thus, a doji in a rally could signal an exhausted market. But with a doji during a price descent, the market may continue its fall. Because 
			of this, doji need more confirmation to signal a bottom than they do a top. For example, a doji that confirms support should be considered 
			although it comes during a decline.
		</li>
		<li>
			To separate a doji during a rally from doji during declines, I call the former Northern doji and the latter Southern doji.
		</li>
		<li>
			Doji may work well at calling bottoms. This brings out a povital point about candle charts in general. All of the candle lines or 
			patterns may be effective in markets (only in some markets). Seeing which works well comes with experience.
		</li>
		<li>
			Doji work better at calling tops reversal than bottom reversals.
		</li>
		<li>
			Where a doji is in relation to its preceding trend is of pivotal importance.

	<h2>THE NORTHERN DOJI (DOJI DURING RALLIES)</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Japanese say that with a doji after a tall white candle, or a doji in an overbought environment, that the market is "tired". 
						That is a wonderfully appropriate way to view doji. A doji may not mean an immediate price reversal. The doji shows us the market 
						is vulnerable, and may be at a transition point. A doji, in a single session, means the trend may be in the process of changing. 
						A doji is a session in which the bulls and bears are in complete balance. The doji indicates that there is something very different 
						on that day (in which the open and close are the same) from the preceding candle lines where the closes were well above the 
						openings.

	<h2>THE LONG-LEGGED DOJI (RICKSHAW MAN), THE GRAVESTONE DOJI, AND THE DRAGONFLY DOJI</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						As shown in the figure above in this section, some doji have nicknames depending on the open / close (i.e., the horizontal 
						components of the doji) is at the low or high of the session or if there are unusually long upper and lower shadows on the doji.
					</li>
					<li>
						A candle line with long upper and lower shadows and a small real body is called a high-wave candle. If such a candle line is a 
						doji instead of a small real body, then it is called a long-legged doji. It also has the nickname rickshaw man.
					</li>
					<li>
						The doji portion of the long-legged doji shows the market is at a transition point. The long upper shadow shows the market had 
						rallied during the session, but by session's end had backed off from these highs. The extended lower shadow visually depicts a 
						market that had sold off during the session; by session's end it had been able, by the close, to recoup some of its lost ground. 
						In other words, the market rallies, sells off, rallies, etc. It is a confused market. These long shadows hint, as the Japanese 
						say, "The market has lost its sense of direction." As such, a long-legged doji is an indication of a market separating from its 
						trend.

			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The gravestone doji is another distinctive doji. It develops when the open, low, and close are at the low of the day. This 
						line is an example of how visually intuitive candles are. Even if you never saw an explanation of the gravestone doji, just 
						by looking at it, would you think it was a bullish or bearish signal? Of course, the answer is bearish. With its extended 
						upper shadow and close at the low of the session, we can graphically see that at some time during the session the stock had 
						rallied and by session's end the bears dragged this stock down to the lows at the close. It can be viewed as the ultimate 
						shooting star. The shooting star has a long upper shadow and small real body. If the shooting star's real body becomes a doji, 
						then we have a gravestone doji.
					</li>
					<li>
						The gravestone's forte is in calling tops. The shape of the gravestone doji makes its name appropriate. As we have discussed, 
						many of the Japanese technical terms are based on military analogies. In Japanese candlestick literature it is said that the 
						gravestone doji represents that gravestone of the bulls that have died defending their territory.
					</li>
					<li>
						As omnious as "gravestone" sounds, it does not imply a large move lower. While the gravestone doji, because of its extended 
						upper shadow and close at the session low, does increase the chances for a turn, it does not forecast the extent of a potential 
						decline. Canlde signals are unexcelled for spotting the early reversals, not to predict the extent of a move.

						The dragonfly doji is the bullish counterpart of the gravestone doji. The dragonfly has the open / close at the highs of 
						the session. This means the market had touched much lower lows during the session, but had impressively managed to close 
						at, or very close to, the highs. This is like a hammer, but the hammer has a small real body where the dragonfly doji has 
						no real body since it is a doji.

						The general concept with doji (and for all candle signals) is that one should look at what happened before the signal. For 
						instance, a doji in a rally is a potential reversal. Therefore, there needs to be a rally to reverse. This means that doji 
						have little forecasting implications if they are in a trading range environment since there is no trend to reverse. The 
						Japanese appropriately call a market that is locked within a range a "box".
					</li>
					<li>
						The doji in the figure (Doji in a Box Range) is reflecting on a micro scale what the trading range environment on a more macro 
						aspect is showing: The market is undecided. With no trend to change, the doji in this figure has no forecasting implications, 
						except for the fact that it is confirming a trendless environment. An exception to this is if a doji, while still in a trading 
						range, is at the top or bottom end of a range. As such, it is conforming resistance or support and could be a useful signal.

						The ideal tri-star top has three doji with the middle doji higher than the first and second doji. While this pattern
