	<h1>JAPANESE CANDLESTICK CHARTING TECHNIQUE</h1>
	<p><b>Last updated on: April 21, 2024</b></p>
	<hr>
	<hr>
	<p>
		The term "candlesticks" also called "candles" is a Japanese chart
		analysis technique that has been refined by generations of use in
		the Far East. Until 1991, the technique remained secret from the
		Western world for over a century because no document ever mentioned
		about it. But, now it is known and accepted worldwide. Some of the
		features of this technique are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Easy to understand</li>
		<li>Provide earlier indications of the market turns and reversal
			signals</li>
		<li>Furnish unique market insights by showing the underpinning
			move</li>
		<li>Enjoyable to learn</li>
		<li>Applicable to any market be it Eastern or Western and enhances
			analysis</li>
		<li>Increases the effeciency of analysis by sending visual
			information</li>
		<li>Based on psychology of market - considers sentiments of
			traders</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>The basics of candlesticks</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Candle - </b>A candle has a real body which is the rectangular 
		section and thin lines above and below the real body called shadows. 
		The top and the bottom sections of the rectangular body represent 
		the open and the close values and the tips of shadows represent 
		the high and the low values. Because of their shape these are 
		called candles. Candles can be drawn using any time frame- from 
		intraday to daily to weekly charts and so on. Multiple variants 
		of candle are shown below:
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 25%;">
				<p>
					<b> The white candle - </b> when the close value is greater than 
					the open value then this is depicted as a white candle.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is also called bulls.

					<b> The black candle - </b> when the open value is greater than

		<b>Shaven head- </b>If a candle has no upper shadow, it is said 
		to have shaven head. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Shaven bottom- </b>A candle with no lower shadow has a shaven 
		bottom. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Spinning top- </b>The japanese term for a small real body 
		(black or white) is a spinning top.

				<b>Doji- </b>When there are no real body i.e. when the

	<h2>Trend reversal</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<p>
					Trend reversal means that the prior trend is about to
					end. This is shown in the figure on the right side of 
					this section. The indicators have indicated that the upward
					movement is about to end. And now one of the three situation
					may happen:
					<ul>
						<li>
							The price will continue to move up a bit and then it 
							will move down.
						</li>
						<li>
							The price will move down and after reaching a point, it 
							will rise again.
						</li>
						<li>
							The price will fall and continue to fall.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Trend reversal is just a caution indicator. The market's
					psychology is in transformation. The same is applicable for downtrend as well.

	<h2>UMBRELLA LINES</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Candles with long lower shadows and small real bodies 
						(black or white) near the top of the range. These are 
						called umbrella lines because they look like umbrellas.
					</li>
					<li>
						These umbrella lines can be either bullish or bearish 
						according to the market environment. <u>The character of 
						umbrella lines changes based on the prevailing trend before 
						the umbrella lines</u>.
					</li>
					<li>
						If an umbrella line emerges during a downtrend, it is 
						a signal that the downtrend should end. In such a scenario, 
						this umbrella line is labeled a <b>hammer</b>, as in "the 
						market is hammering out" a base.
					</li>
					<li>
						The actual Japanese word for the hammer is <b>takuri</b>.
						The hammer line looks like a hammer with its head and handle.
						The hammer's long lower shadow and the close at, or near, the 
						high of the session graphically relays that the market sold off 
						sharply during the session and then bounced back to close at, or 
						near, the session's high. this could have bullish ramifications. 
						This aspect of closing at or near highs is why the hammer should 
						have no, or a miniscule, upper shodow. If there was a long upper 
						shadow, this would mean the market closed well off its highs, 
						which is an important criterion for the hammer. A lower shadow 
						is necessary because it would display that the market had been 
						pushed downsharply lower during the session, but by the end 
						of the session, there was a "kamikaze fight" as the bears lost 
						controls is depicted by the fact that the market closed at, or near, 
						its session highs.
					</li>
					<li>
						One interesting aspect, a very long shadow hammer means that by the time the hammer is confirmed (we need to wait for a close to confirm 
						the hammer), the market could be well off its lows. Buying at the close of such a hammer may not present an attractive risk/reward since 
						the market may retrace back to the lows of the hammer before, potentially, resuming an upward course. A high-volume hammer decreases the 
						chance for a correction to the hammer's low. Therefore, one may be more aggressive about buying on the hammer's close if it is a usually 
						high-volume hammer than one would if the volume didn't give the same forceful confirmation.
					</li>
					<li>
						If either of lines emerges after a rally, it is a potential 
						top reversal signal called <b>a hanging man</b>. The name 
						"hanging man" is derived from the fact that it looks like a 
						hanging man with dangling legs. It has the same shape as the 
						hammer. The only difference is that a hanging man comes after 
						an advance. A close beneath the hanging man is preffered. 
						<u>It is advisable to wait for bearish confirmation after 
							a hanging man.</u>
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>The colour of the the real body does not make any difference.</u>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The hammer and hanging man can be recognized by three 
					criteria:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The real body is at the upper end of the trading range.
						The colour of the real body is not important.
					</li>
					<li>
						It has a long lower shadow that should be at least twice 
						the height of the real body.
					</li>
					<li>
						It should have no, or a very short, upper shadow.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p> 
					There are three aspects that differentiate the hanging man 
					from hammer- trend, extent of the move before the candle line,
					and the confirmation.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Trend: </b>A hammer must come after a decline. A hanging man
						must come after a rally.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Extent of the move before the candle line: </b>A hammer is valid
						even if it comes after a short-term decline, but a hanging man should
						emerge after an extended rally, preferably at an all-time high.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Confirmation: </b>A hanging man should be confirmed, while a 
						hammer need not be.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The longer the lower shadow, the shorter the upper shadow; the 
					smaller the real body, the more meaningful the bullish hammer or 
					bearish hanging man.

	<h2>THE ENGULFING PATTERN</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Most candle signals are based on combinations of 
						individual candle lines. The engulfing pattern is 
						the first of these multiple candle line patterns.
					</li>
					<li>
						The engulfing pattern is a major reversal signal 
						with two opposite colour real bodies composing a 
						pattern.
					</li>
					<li>
						Another name for the engulfing pattern is a "hugging 
						line".
					</li>
					<li>
						The figure shown on the right (above) of this section 
						shows <b>a bullish	englufing pattern</b>. The market 
						is falling. And then a white bullish real body wraps 
						around, or engulfs, the prior period's black real body. 
						This shows buying pressure has over-whelmed selling 
						pressure.
					</li>
					<li>
						The figure shown on the right (below) of this section 
						shows <b>a bearish engulfing pattern</b>. Here the 
						market is trending higher. A white real body engulfed 
						by a black real body is the signal for a top reversal. 
						This also shows that supply has overwhelmed demand.
					</li>
					<li>
						The significance of the bearish engulfing pattern will increase if there is a lighter volume on the first candle (the white) and a 
						heavier volume on the second candle (the black).
					</li>			
				</ul>
				<ol>
					There are three criteria for an engulfing pattern:
					<li>
						The market has to be in a <u>clearly definable uptrend 
						(for a bearish engulfing pattern) or downtrend (for
						a bullish englufing pattern), even if the trend is 
						short term</u>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Two candles comprise the engulfing pattern. The second 
						real body must engulf the prior real body (<u>it need not 
						engluf the shadows</u>).
					</li>
					<li>
						The second real body of the engulfing pattern should be 
						the opposite colour of the first real body. The exception 
						to this rule is if the first real body of the engulfing 
						pattern is a doji. Thus, after an extended fall, a doji 
						engulfed by a very large white real body could be a bottom 
						reversal. In an uptrend, a doji enveloped by a very large 
						black real body could be a bearish reversal pattern.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					Some factors increasing the likelihood that an engulfing 
					pattern could be an important turning signal are:
					<li>
						If the first day of the engulfing pattern has a very small 
						real body (i.e., a spinning top) and the second day has a 
						very long real body. The small first real body candle 
						reflects a dissipation of the prior trend's force and the 
						large second real body proves an increase in the force 
						behind the new move.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the engulfing pattern appears after a protracted or very 
						fast move. A fast or extended move creates an overextended 
						market (either overbought or oversold) and makes it vulnerable 
						to profit taking.
					</li>
					<li>
						If there is heavy volume on the second real body of the 
						engulfing pattern. 
					</li>

	<h2>DARK-CLOUD COVER</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						It is a reversal pattern. It is a dual-candle pattern 
						that is a top reversal after an uptrend or, at times, 
						at the top of a congestion band.
					</li>
					<li>
						The first day of this two-candle pattern is a strong white 
						real body. The second day's price opens above the prior 
						session's high (that is, above the top of the upper shadow).
						However, by the end of the second day's session, the market 
						closes deeply within the prior day's white body. 
					</li>
					<li>
						The greater the degree of penetration into the white body, the 
						more likely this is a top. <u>Some Japanese technicians require 
						more than a 50-percent penetration of the black session's close 
					    into the white real body.</u> 
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>If the black candles does not close below the halfway point 
						of the white candlestick, it may be best to wait for more 
						bearish confirmation following the dark-cloud cover.</b> 
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>In some cases it is considered as a 
						dark-cloud cover even if the open is over the prior session's 
					    close instead of the prior session's high.</u>
					</li>
					<li>
						The rationale behind this bearish pattern is readily explained. 
						On the first session of the dark-cloud cover, the market is 
						ascending with a strong white candle. This is followed by a gap 
						higher on the next session's opening. Thus far, the bulls are in 
						complete control. But then the whole technical picture changes as, 
						on the second day of this pattern, the market closed not only 
						beneath the prior close, but well within the prior day's real body, 
						offsetting much of the gain of the first session. In such scenario, 
						the longs will have second thoughts about their position.
					</li>
					<li>
						Those who were waiting for selling short now have a benchmark to 
						place a stop <u>at the new high of the second day of the dark-cloud 
						cover pattern</u>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Just as a bearish engulfing pattern can be resistance, so too <b>the 
						highest high of the two sessions that formed the dark-cloud 
						cover should be resistance</b>.
					</li>
				</ul>

					<p><u>Dark Cloud Cover</u></p>
				</Center>
				
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<ol>
		Some factors intensifying the importance of the dark-cloud covers include:
		<li>
			The greater the penetration of the black real body's close into the 
			prior white real body, the greater the chance for a 
			top. <u>If the black real body covers the prior day's entire white 
			body, it would be a bearish engulfing pattern rather than a dark-cloud 
			cover.</u> <b>A bearish engulfing pattern, consequently, can be a more 
			meaningful top reversal. If a long white real body closes above the highs
		    of the dark-cloud cover, or the bearish engulfing pattern it could 
		    indicate another rally</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			During a prolonged ascent, if there is a strong white day that opens 
			on its low (that is, a shaven bottom) and closes on its high (that is,
			a shaven head) and the next day reveals a long black real body day, 
			opening on its high and closing on its low, then a shaven head and 
			shaven bottom black day has occurred.
		</li>
		<li>
			If the second body (i.e., the black body) of the dark-cloud covers 
			opens above a major resistance level and then fails, it would prove 
			the bulls were unable to take control of the market.
		</li>
		<li>
			If on the opening of the second day, there is very heavy volume, 
			then a buying blow off could have occurred. For example, heavy volume 
			at a new opening high could mean that many new buyers have decided to 
			jump abroad ship. Then the market sells off. <b>For future traders, 
			very high opening interest can be another warning</b>.

	<h2>PIERCING PATTERN</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The dark-cloud cover's counterpart is the bullish piercing 
						pattern. The piercing pattern is composed of two candles in 
						a falling market.The first candle is a black real body day 
						and the second is a white real body. This white candle opens
						lower, ideally under the low of the prior black day. Then the 
						prices rebound to push well into the black candle's real body. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<center>
					<img src="piercing-pattern.png" alt="Piercing pattern">
					<p><u>Piercing pattern</u></p>
				</center>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The piercing pattern is similar to the bullish engulfing pattern.
						In the bullish engulfing pattern, the white real body engulfs the 
						entire previous black real body. For the piercing pattern, the 
						white real body pierces, but does not wrap around, the prior black 
						body. 
					</li>
					<li>
						In the piercing pattern, the greater the degree of penetration into 
						the black real body, the more likely it will become a bottom reversal. 
						An ideal piercing pattern will have a white real body that pushes more 
						than halfway into the prior session's black real body. The psychology 
						behind the piercing pattern is as follows: 
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The market is in a downtrend. The bearish black real body reinforces 
							this view.
						</li>
						<li>
							The next session the market opens lower via a gap. The bears are watching the 
							market with happiness.
						</li>
						<li>
							Then the market surges toward the close, managing not only to close unchanged 
							from the prior day's close, but sharply above that close. The bears will be 
							second-guessing their position.
						</li>
						<li>
							Those who are looking to buy would say new lows could not hold and could view 
							it as an opportunity to buy.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>
						The piercing pattern signal increases in importance based on the same factors 
						1 through 4 as with the dark-cloud cover, but in reverse.
					</li>
					<li>
						With the dark-cover we would like to see the black real body closing more than 
						midway in the prior white candlestick. But there is some flexibility to this rule.
						There is less flexibility with the piercing pattern. <u>The piercing pattern's white 
						candlestick should push more than halfway into the black candlestick's real body</u>.
					</li>
					<li>
						The reason for less latitude with the bullish piercing pattern than with the bearish 
						dark-cloud cover pattern is the fact that the Japanese have three other patterns 
						called <i>the on-neck, the in-neck, and the thrusting pattern</i>. 
					</li>
					<li>
						All three have same basic formation as the piercing pattern. The difference among them 
						is in the degree of penetration by the white candle into the black candle's real body.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>The on-neck pattern- </b>The on-neck pattern's white candle (usually a small one) 
						closes near the low of the previous session.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>The in-neck pattern- </b> The in-neck pattern's white candle closes slightly into 
						the prior real body (it should also be a small white candle).
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>The thrusting pattern- </b>The thrusting pattern should be a longer white candle that 
						is stronger than the in-neck pattern, but still does not close above the middle of the 
						prior black body.
					</li>
					<li>
						The general concept that one should view a non-ideal candle pattern by:
						<ol>
							<li>
								How it was formed
							</li>
							<li>
								Within the overall market picture
							</li>
						</ol>
						These two factors will help us gauge if the less-than-perfect pattern could have 
						the same implications as a more classicly defined candle pattern. It is the 
						subjectivity that makes computer recognition of candle patterns so difficult.
					</li>
					<li>
						With the piercing pattern, we would like to see <b>lighter volume on the black candle and heavier volume on the white candle</b>. 
						This would serve to reinforce that the bears are loosing force and the bulls are gaining a strong foothold. This volume 
						scenario also increases the odds that the piercing pattern will hold.

						The morning star is a bottom reversal pattern. Its 
						name is derived because, like the morning star (the 
						nickname for the planet Mercury) that foretells the 
						sunrise, it indicates higher prices. There are three 
						candle lines comprising this pattern:
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Candle 1</b>: An <b>extended black real body</b>. This pictorially 
							proves that the bears are in command.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Candle 2</b>: A <b>small real body that doesn't touch the prior 
							real body</b> (these two lines comprise a basic star pattern). 
							The small real body means sellers are losing the capacity 
							to drive the market lower.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Candle 3</b>: The concluding candle of the morning star is a <b>white 
							real body that intrudes deeply into the first session's black 
							candle</b>. This is the indication that the bulls have seized control.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>
						<b>The lowest low of the three lines that form this pattern 
						should be support</b> as hown by the dashed line.
					</li>
					<li>
						An ideal morning star would have a gap between the second 
						and the third bodies. Although, a lack of gap does not seem 
						to weaken the power of this formation. <b>The decisive factor 
						is that the second candle should be a spinning top and the 
						third candle pushes well into the black candle</b>.
					</li>
					<li>
						A limitation with the morning star is that since this is a three-candle 
						pattern, one has to wait until the close of the third session to 
						complete the pattern. As is usually the case, if this third candle is 
						a tall white one, we would get the signal well after the market already 
						had a sharp bounce. In other words, the completion of the morning star 
						may not present an attractive risk.reward trading opportunity. An option 
						is waiting for a correction to the morning star's support area to start 
						cautiously from the long side.

	<table>

				<ul>
					<li>
						The evening star is the bearish counterpart of the morning star 
						pattern. It is named so because the evening star (the nickname 
						for the planet Venus) appears just before darkness sets in. Since 
						the evening star is a top reversal, it should be acted upon if it 
						arises after an uptrend.
					</li>
					<li>
						Three lines compose the evening star:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The first is a long white body.
							</li>
							<li>
								The next is a star. The star is the first hint of a top.
							</li>
							<li>
								The third line corroborates a top and completes the three-line 
								pattern of the evening star.The third line is a black body that 
								closes sharply into the first period's white real body.
							</li>
							<li>
								Evening star pattern is analogous to a traffic light. The traffic 
								light goes from green (the bullish white body) to yellow (the star's 
								warning signal) to red (the black real body confirming the prior trend 
								has stopped).
							</li>
							<li>
								An evening star should have a gap between the first and the second real bodies 
								and then another gap between the second and the third real bodies. But, this 
								second gap is rarely seen and is not necessary for the success of this pattern. 
								The main concern should be the extent of the intrusion of the third day's black 
								real body into the first day's white body.
							</li>
							<li>
								Some factors increasing the likelihood that an evening or morning star could be 
								a reversal would include:
								<ol>
									<li>
										If there is no overlap among the first, second, and the third real bodies.
									</li>
									<li>
										If the third candle closes deeply into the first candle's real body.
									</li>
									<li>
										If there is light volume on the first candle session and heavy volume on 
										the third candle session. This would show a reduction of the force for 
										the prior trend and an increase in the direction force of the new trend.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								The highs of the evening star become resistance as displayed by the dashed line.

						<b>The shooting star- </b> has a small real body at the lower end of

						is derived. It looks like a shooting star with its long tail blazing 
						across the sky. The Japanese say that the shooting star shows trouble 
						overhead.
					</li>
					<li>
						Since it is one session, it is usually not a major reversal signal as 
						is the bearish engulfing pattern or evening star. The shooting star 
						does not shows resistance unlike the bearish engulfing pattern or evening 
						star.
					</li>
					<li>
						The shooting star is a bearish reversal signal, it must come after a rally.
						An ideal shooting star has a real body that gaps away from the prior real 
						body. Nonetheless, as will be seen in several chart examples, this gap is not 
						always necessary. A lack of rising gap is more of a reason to be negative on 
						the shooting star. The trend could be turning less bullish if the shooting 
						star has no gap.
					</li>
					<li>
						When we get signal after signal at the same price level, it reinforces that

					<li>
						If a shooting star-shaped candle line comes after a downturn, it could be a bullish 
						signal. Such a line is called an <b>inverted hammer</b>. Although the inverted hammer has 
						the same form as a shooting star, it is not a star pattern.

			Inverted hammer has the same form as a shooring star with its long upper shadow and

			star and inverted hammer is that the inverted comes after a decline. As, a result while 
			the shooting star is a top reversal line, the inverted hammer is a bottom reversal line. 
			The colour of the inverted hammer's real body doesn't matter. This concept is similar to 
			the hammer and the hanging man concept in which the same shape line is bullish or bearish 
			depending on the preceeding trend. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Just as a hanging man needs bearish confirmation, the inverted hammer needs bullish confirmation. 
			This confirmation could be in the form of the next day opening above the inverted hammer's real 
			body or especially a close the next day over the inverted hammer's real body. <u>The reason for 
			the required bullish verification of the inverted hammer is because its long upper shadow gives 
			the inverted hammer a bearish hue. To be aware of the inverted hammer session, the market opens on, 
		    or near, its low and then rallies. The bulls fail to sustain the rally and prices close at, or near, 
			the lows of the session. If the next day opens, and especially closes, over the inverted hammer's real 
			body, the more likely these shorts will cover. This cold spark a short covering rally that could lead

	<h2>THE HARAMI PATTERN</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Spinning tops (that is, small real bodies) are components in certain formations. The 
						harami is one of these formations (the star, examined in chapter 5, in another).The 
						harami pattern is a small real body that is contained within what the Japanese call 
						"an unusually long black or white real body."
					</li>
					<li>
						"Harami" is an old Japanese word for pregnant. The Japanese nickname for the long 
						candle is the "mother" candle and the small is the "baby" or "fetus". The second 
						candle of the harami can be white or black. If, for example, both the first and 
						second candles of the harami are white, it would be expressed as "white-white harami".
					</li>
					<li>
						The Japanese will say that with a harami the market is "loosing its breadth". The 
						bearish harami displays a disparity about the market's health. Specifically after 
						a bull move, the long white real body's vitality is followed by the small real body's 
						uncertainity. Additionally, the small real body opening and closing within the prior 
						open-close range is another indication that the bulls' upward drive has weekened. Thus, 
						a trend reversal is possible.

		<li>
			During a bear move, the selling force reflected by a long black real body is followed by the 
			second day's inability to decide actions. This could be a sign that a possibility of trend 
			reversal since the second day's small real body is an alert that the bears' power has dimished.
			The combination of candle lines in the harami pattern, with its first tall real body followed 
			by a small real body, is the reverse of the engulfing pattern. In the engulfing pattern, a 
			lengthy real body engulfs the preceding small real body. Another difference between the harami 
			and engulfing pattern is that for the two candles of the engulfing pattern, the colour of the 
			real bodies should be opposite. This is not necessary for the harami. However, in most instances, 
			the real bodies in the harami pattern are oppositely coloured. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The entire range of the second session may not be within range of the first session. For harami 
			all that is required is that the second real body be within the first real body, even if the 
			shadow of the second day is above or below the prior day's high and low. In the figure (left side) 
			shown in this section, on the second sessio the upper shadow moved over the prior white real body. 
			This is still a harami because the second session's real body was contained within the first real 
			body.

						The regular harami has a tall real body followed by a small real body. Yet, there are no rules as to what 
						is considered "small" candle. This, like many other charting techniques, is subjective. A the general 
						principle, the more diminutive the second real body, the more potent the pattern. This is usually true 
						because the smaller the real body, the greater the ambivalence and the more likely a trend reversal. In 
						the extremes, as the real body becomes smaller as the spread between the open and close narrows, a doji 
						is formed. doji preceded by a long blackreal body during a decline (or a tall white real body during a rally)
						is distinctive type of harami reffered to as a harami cross.
					</li>
					<li>
						The harami cross, becasue it contains a doji, is viewed as a strong reversal signal than the regular 
						harami pattern by the Japanese. The harami cross is sometimes referred to as the petrifying pattern. 
						The best way to justify this name is that the preceeding trend has been frozen or petrified in 
						preparation for a reverse move. A harami cross occuring after a very long white candle is a pattern 
						a long trader ignores at his or her own peril. Harami cross can also call bottoms, but they seem more 
						efffective at tops.

				<ul>
					<li>
						Tweezers are two or more candle lines with matching highs or lows. They are called tweezers tops and
						tweezers bottoms because they are compared to the two prongs of a tweezers. In a rising market, a 
						tweezers top is formed when the two or more consecutive highs match. In a falling market, a tweezers 
						bottom is made when two or more successive lows are the same. The tweezers could be composed of real 
						bodies, shadows, and/or doji. Ideally the tweezers should have a long first candle and a small real 
						body as the next session. This shows that whatever force the market had on the first session (bullish 
						force with a long white candle and bearish force with a long black candle), it was dissolving with the 
						following small real body with the same high (for a tweezers top) or same low (top a tweezers bottom). 
						If there is a bearish (for a top reversal) or a bullish (for a bottom reversal) candle signal that is 
						also a tweezers top, it adds more importance to the pattern.

					<li>
						The bearish belt-hold is a long black candle that opens on the high of the session (on within a few ticks

						black candle is usually a long white one.) The two black candles are the "crows" in this pattern. They are analogous 
						to black crows peering down ominously from a tree branch. Based on this portentous (bombastic) comparision, it is 
						obviously a bearish pattern. An ideal upside-gap two crows has  the second black real body opening above the first 
						black real body's open. It then closes under the first black candle's close.
					</li>
					<li>
						The rationale for the bearish aspect of this pattern is as follows: 
						<ul>
							<li>
								The market is in an uptrend and gaps higher on the open.
							</li>
							<li>
								The new highs fail to hold and the market forms a black candle.

								into the close. More negative, however, is that this session closes under the prior day's close. <u>If the market 
								is so strong, why did the new highs fail to hold and why did the market close lower?</u> Those are the questions 
								that the bulls are probably nervously asking themselves. The answers might be that the market may not be so strong

						The opposite of the three black crows is three advancing white soliders or, more commonly, three white soliders. Like much 
						of the candle terminology, this pattern has a military association. It is a group of three long white candles with consecutively 
						higher closes. If this pattern appears at low price area or after a period of stable prices, then it is a sign of strength ahead.
						The three white soliders are a gradual and steady rise with each white line opening within or near the prior session's white real 
						body. Each of the white candles should close at, or near, its highs. It is a healthy method for the market to rise (although if 
						the white candles are very extended, one should be catious about an overbought market).

						If the second and the third or just candle shows signs of weakening, it is an advance block pattern. This means the rally is

						Signs of weakening could be progressively smaller white real bodies or relatively long upper shadows.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the last two candles are long white ones that make a new high followed by a small white candle, it is called a stalled 
						pattern. It is also sometimes called a deliberation pattern. The bulls' strength has been at least temporarily exhausted 
						after this formation. This last small white candle can either gap away from the long white body (in which case it becomes 
						a star) or it can be, as Japanese express it, "riding on the shoulder" of the long white body (i.e., be at the upper end 
						of the prior long white real body). The small real body discloses a deterioration of the bulls' power.
					</li>
					<li>
						Although the advance block and stalled patterns are not normally top reversal patterns, they can sometimes precede a 
						price decline.The advance block and stalled patterns should be used to liquidate or protect longs, but usually not to

						There is not much difference between the advanced block and stalled pattern. The main factor to consider with three

						clue that the rally is losing force.

	<h2>THREE MOUNTAINS AND THREE RIVERS</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>
						There is a group of longer-term topping and bottoming pattern that include the three moauntain, three rivers, the three 
						Buddha tops, inverted three Buddha, dumpling tops, fry-pan bottoms, and tower tops and bottoms.
					</li>
					<li>
						Three mountain top is supposed to represent a major top. If the market backs off from a high three times or makes three 
						attempts at a high, it is deemed a three mountain top. The high point of the final mountain ideally should be confirmed 
						with a bearish candle indicator (for example, a doji or dark-cloud cover). If the central mountain of a three mountain 
						top is the highest mountain, it is a special type of three mountain called a three Buddha top. The reason for this name 
						is because, in Buddhist temples, there is a large central Buddha with smaller Buddhas (i.e., saints) on both sides. This 
						is the same pattern as the West's head and shoulders top. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Although the three Buddha top is analogous to the Western head and shoulders pattern, the theory about the japanese three 
						Buddha pattern was used over a hundred years before the head and shoulders was known in America. (The earliest reference 
						seen to a head and shoulders pattern in the United States was by Richard Schabaker in the 1930s).
					</li>
					<li>
						It is intriguing how market observers from both the West and the East have come up with this same pattern. Market 
						psychology is the same around the world, or, as a Japanese proverb expresses, "The tone of a bird's song is the same
						everywhere".
					</li>
					<li>
						The three river bottom pattern is the opposite of the three mountain top. This occurs when the market tests a bottom level 
						three times. The peak of the troughs should be exceeded to confirm a bottom. The equivalent of the Western inverted head 
						and shoulders bottom is called, not surprisingly, an inverted three Buddha.
					</li>
					<li>
						The peaks of each mountain were almost the same. This is not necessary. It is still considered a three mountain top if 
						the three price peaks are not exactly at the same highs. If A, B, and C are three peaks where B and C are slightly higher 
						levels. This would still be considered a three mountain top.

	<h2>COUNTERATTACK LINES</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Counterattack lines are formed when opposite coloured candles have the same close. The best way to describe this pattern is 
						by discussing the illustrations on the right-side of this section. The figure above is an example of a bullish counterattack 
						line. This pattern occurs during a decline. The first candle of this pattern is usually a long black candle. The next session 
						opens sharply lower. At this point, the bears are feeling confident. The bulls then stage their counterattack as they push 
						prices back up to unchanged from the prior close. The prior downtrend has then been suspended.
					</li>
					<li>
						The bullish counterattack is comparable to the bullish piercing line. If you remember, the piercing line has the same 
						two-candle configuration as that shown for the bullish counterattack pattern. The main differnece is that the bullish 
						counterattack line does not move into the prior session's white real body. It just gets back to the prior session's 
						close. The piercing pattern's second line pushes well into the black real body. Consequently, the piercing pattern is 
						a more significant bottom reversal than is the bullish counterattack line. Nonetheless, as shown in same examples below, 
						the bullish counterattack line should be respected, since it proves that there is a change in the flow of direction of 
						the market.
					</li>
					<li>
						The figure below is the bullish counterattack line is the bearish counterattack line. The first candle, a long white one, 
						keeps the bullish momentum going. The next session's opening gaps higher. The longs are happy then the bears come out 
						fighting and pull prices to the prior day's close. The bulls' tide of optimism on the second day's opening probably turned 
						to apprehension by the close. As the bullish counterattack line is rlated to the piercing line, so the bearish counterattack 
						line is related to the dark-cloud cover. The bearish counterattack line is realted to the dark-cloud cover. The bearish 
						counteratack, like the dark-cloud cover, should ideally open above the prior day's high. Unlike the dark-cloud cover, though, 
						the close does not go into the prior day's white candle. Thus, the dark-cloud cover sends a stronger top reversal signal than 
						does the bearish counterattack line.
					</li>
					<li>
						An important consideration of the counterattack lines is that second session should open robustly higher (in the case of the 
						bearish counterattack) or sharply lower (for the bullish counterattack). The idea is that on the opening of the second day of 
						this pattern, the market has moved slightly in the direction of the original trend. Then, by the close, it moves back to unchanged 
						from the prior session. In doing so, it changes the market's texture in one day.
					</li>
					<li>
						A mentioned in the secion of three black crows, becasue we need to wait for three black candles for the completion of 
						that signal, much of the move may be lost bt the time the third candle of the three black crows unfolds. In this case, 
						however, eith the first black candle's counterattack line, we would have received an early tirning signal in one session 
						that was further confirmed with the three black crows.

						terminology.)

					<li>
						The market is ascending with higher highs and goes into a period where the highs are the same, and then goes to lower highs.

						more proof that the bears have lost control of the market. The Japanese will say that with a frypan bottom the parket becomes

	<h2>CONTINUATION PATTERNS</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Most candle signals are trend reversals. There are , however, a group of candle patterns that are continuation indicators. A continuation 
			pattern is one in which the market should continue the same trend as that in force before the continuation pattern. For instance, a continuation 
			pattern following a rally means that the trend remains up and we should expect the rally to remain in force. (This, however, does not preclude a 
			correction after the continuation pattern before the rally, hopefully, unfolds.)
		</li>
		<li>
			As the Japanese express it, "Thre are time to buy, times to sell, and times to rest". Many of these continuation patterns imply a time to
			rest, a breather, before the market resumes its prior trend. The continuation formations reviewed in this chapter are windows (and patterns
			that include windows), the rising and falling three methods, separating lines, and three white soliders.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>WINDOWS</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Japanese refer to what we call in the West a gap as a window. Whereas the Western expression is "filling in the gap",
						the Japanese would say, "closing the window". There are two kinds of windows, one bullish and other bearish.
					</li>
					<li>
						A rising window is a bullish signal. There is a price vacuum between the prior session's high (that is, the top of the upper 
						shadow) and the current session's low (e.g., the bottom of the lower shadow).
					</li>
					<li>
						It is said by the Japanese technicians to "go in the dirrection of the window". This is because windows are continuation signals.
						Consequently, <b>with the emergence of a rising window, one should look to buy on dips, and with a falling window to sell on bounces</b>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>It is also said by the Japanese that "corrections stop at the window". This means windows can become support and resistance 
						areas. Thus, a rising window (the entire window) should also be a zone of support on pullbacks. If the pullback closes under the 
						bottom of the window, the prior uptrend is voided</u>. In the rising window figure, the market got under the bottom of the window, 
						but since it didn't close under this area, the rising windows support remains intact.
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>
							The entire rising window becomes a potential support zone. The disadvantage with a large window is that the whole zone 
							is potential support. Consequently, we don't have so tight a support (with a rising window) or resistance (with a falling 
							window) as one would have with a very small window.
						</u>
					</li>
					<li>
						If there are two windows. Window 1 and window 2, window 2 being at higher price levels. After window 2 is breached, the 
						window 1 becomes support. If a window support is broken, look for another window under the one that was broken as next 
						support area.

				<ul>
					<li>
						Falling window is a bearish signal in which there is a gap between the prior sesion's low and the current session's high.
					</li>
					<li>
						Likewise, a falling window implies still lower levels. Any price rebounds should run into resistance at this falling 
						window (the entire window). If the bulls have enough force to close the market above the top of the falling window, the
						downtrend is done.
					</li>
					<li>
						There is a belief in the West that a gap is always filled. But as we have seen that corrections stop at a window, once 
						prices try to fill a gap we can then consider buying (in a rising window) or selling (in a falling window).
					</li>
					<li>
						There is a common misunderstanding with windows that the real bodies don't touch. In case the shadows overlap, it is not a 
						window. So, no overlap between shadows is the main criteria for window. No matter how large the "gap" between the real bodies, 
						it is not a window unless there is a space between the shadows.
					</li>
					<li>
						No matter how tiny a rising window, that window should be potential support. The same is true with a falling window as 
						resistance.
					</li>
					<li>
						Size doesn't matter with windows. Although the rising window's support zone before bouncing. Therefore, if you are 
						aggressively bullish as a market approaches the rising window, you can consider buying as a market approaches the rising 
						window, you can consider buying even if it gets close to the top of the window. How one uses a window is dependent on 
						trading style and aggressiveness. There should be a stop (mental or otherwise) if the market clsoes under the bottom of 
						the rising window.

						The rising three methods is composed of:
						<ol>
							<li>
								A long white candle.
							</li>
							<li>
								The white candle is followed by a group of falling or lateral small real body candles. The ideal number of small 
								candles is three but two or more than three are also acceptable if they hold within the long white candle's high-low 
								range. Think of the small candles as forming a pattern similar to a three-day harami pattern since they hold within 
								the first session's range. (For this pattern, that would include holding within the shadows; for a true harami they 
								would have to hold with the real body.) The small candles can be either colour, but black is most ideal for this pattern.
							</li>
							<li>
								The final day should be a strong white real body session with a close above the first day's close. The final candle 
								line should ideally also open above the close of the previous session.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						This patttern resembles the Western bull flag or pennant formation. Yet the concept behind the rising three methods is from 
						the 1700s. The three methods pattern is considered a rest from trading and a rest from battle. In more modern terms, the 
						market is, with the group of small candles, "taking a breather".
					</li>
					<li>
						The ideal rising three methods has three small black real bodies within the entire trading range of a white real body.
					</li>
					<li>
						The challange we have with the rising three methods is from a risk / reward aspect. By the time the rising three methods 
						is completed, a stock might be far from its most recent lows. In such a secnario, buying on the completion of the three 
						methods may not offer an attractive trade. As such, one should think of the potential profit once the rising three methods 
						is completed compared to its risk (the risk being low of the white candle that stated the rising three methods).

	<h2>SEPARATING LINES</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The separating lines have the same open as the previous opposite colour candle. The separating line is a continuation 
						pattern. It is easy to see why. During a market rise, a black real body (especially a relatively long one) would be a 
						bull's cause for concern. The bears might be gaining control. However, if the next session's opening gaps high enough 
						to open at the previous black session's opening price, it impressively proves that the bears have lost control of the 
						market- especially if that session closes as a white candle. This is the scenario that unfolds with the bullish 
						separating line as shown in the figure (in this section). The white line ideally should also be a bullish belt-hold 
						(that is, open in the low of teh session and close at, or near, the high of the session). 
					</li>
					<li>
						The opposite would be true with a bearish separating line in the figure (shown in this section). This is viewed as a 
						bearish continuation signal. Separating lines are rare. While most of us would like to see an ideal version of a particular 
						candle pattern, even variations of these patterns can also prove useful.
					</li>
					<li>
						Although the bullish separating lines are rare, they normally appear during a rally. There are a few instances, however, 
						where a bullish separating line can help signal a bottom.

	<h2>THE MAGIC DOJI</h2>
	<center>
		<img src="the-magic-doji.png" alt="The magic doji">
	</center>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The doji is a significant reversal indicator. The doji is a distinct trend change signal, especially during rallies. The likelihood 
			of a reversal with the emergence of a doji increses if:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Subsequent candles confirm the doji's reversal potential.
				</li>
				<li>
					The market is overbought or oversold.
				</li>
				<li>
					The market doesn't have many doji. If there are numerous doji on a particular chart, one should not view the emergence of a new doji 
					as a meaningful development.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			The ideal doji sesssion has the same opening and closing price, yet there is some flexibility to this rule. If the opening and closing prices 
			are within a few ticks of each other (for example, a few cents in stocks or a few thirty-seconds in bonds, and so on), the line could still 
			be viewed as a doji.
		</li>
		<li>
			To decide whether a near-doji day (that is, where the open and close are very close, but not exact) should be considered a doji or not should 
			be based on:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Compare a near-doji in relation to recent action. If there were a series of very small real bodies, the near-doji day would not 
					be viewed as significant since so many other recent periods had small real bodies. If, however, a doji like session emerges among 
					tall candles, then we can say that such a session could have the same implications as a doji since this session is displaying 
					there is something very different on that session from the preceding action.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the market is at an important market junction.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the market is extremely overbought or oversold.
				</li>
				<li>
					If there are other technical signals sending out an alert.
				</li>
			</ol> 
		</li>
		<li>
			Since a doji can be a significant warning, it is better to attend to a false warning than to ignore a real one.
		</li>
		<li>
			Doji are valued for their ability to call market tops. This is especially true after a long white candle in an uptrend.
		</li>
		<li>
			The reason for the doji's potential negative implications in uptrends is because a doji represents indecision. Indecision, uncertainty, 
			or vacillation by buyers will not maintain a rally. It takes the conviction of buyers to sustain a rally. If the market has had an extended 
			rally, and / or is overbought, and then a doji surfaces, it could mean the scaffolding of buyers' support will give way.
		</li>
		<li>
			A caveat, from my experience, is that as successful as doji are at calling tops, they tend to lose some reversal potential in downtrends. 
			The reason may be that a doji reflects a balance between buying and selling forces. With ambivalent market participants, the market could 
			fall, as the market saying goes, "fall of its own weight". This is similar to the idea that strong volume is more important to confirm 
			an upside breakout than volume confirmation for a downside breakout.
		</li>
		<li>
			Thus, a doji in a rally could signal an exhausted market. But with a doji during a price descent, the market may continue its fall. Because 
			of this, doji need more confirmation to signal a bottom than they do a top. For example, a doji that confirms support should be considered 
			although it comes during a decline.
		</li>
		<li>
			To separate a doji during a rally from doji during declines, I call the former Northern doji and the latter Southern doji.
		</li>
		<li>
			Doji may work well at calling bottoms. This brings out a povital point about candle charts in general. All of the candle lines or 
			patterns may be effective in markets (only in some markets). Seeing which works well comes with experience.
		</li>
		<li>
			Doji work better at calling tops reversal than bottom reversals.
		</li>
		<li>
			Where a doji is in relation to its preceding trend is of pivotal importance.

					<li>
						The Japanese say that with a doji after a tall white candle, or a doji in an overbought environment, that the market is "tired". 
						That is a wonderfully appropriate way to view doji. A doji may not mean an immediate price reversal. The doji shows us the market 
						is vulnerable, and may be at a transition point. A doji, in a single session, means the trend may be in the process of changing. 
						A doji is a session in which the bulls and bears are in complete balance. The doji indicates that there is something very different 
						on that day (in which the open and close are the same) from the preceding candle lines where the closes were well above the 
						openings.

						As shown in the figure above in this section, some doji have nicknames depending on the open / close (i.e., the horizontal

					</li>
					<li>
						A candle line with long upper and lower shadows and a small real body is called a high-wave candle. If such a candle line is a 
						doji instead of a small real body, then it is called a long-legged doji. It also has the nickname rickshaw man.
					</li>
					<li>
						The doji portion of the long-legged doji shows the market is at a transition point. The long upper shadow shows the market had 
						rallied during the session, but by session's end had backed off from these highs. The extended lower shadow visually depicts a 
						market that had sold off during the session; by session's end it had been able, by the close, to recoup some of its lost ground. 
						In other words, the market rallies, sells off, rallies, etc. It is a confused market. These long shadows hint, as the Japanese 
						say, "The market has lost its sense of direction." As such, a long-legged doji is an indication of a market separating from its 
						trend.

						The gravestone doji is another distinctive doji. It develops when the open, low, and close are at the low of the day. This 
						line is an example of how visually intuitive candles are. Even if you never saw an explanation of the gravestone doji, just 
						by looking at it, would you think it was a bullish or bearish signal? Of course, the answer is bearish. With its extended 
						upper shadow and close at the low of the session, we can graphically see that at some time during the session the stock had 
						rallied and by session's end the bears dragged this stock down to the lows at the close. It can be viewed as the ultimate 
						shooting star. The shooting star has a long upper shadow and small real body. If the shooting star's real body becomes a doji, 
						then we have a gravestone doji.
					</li>
					<li>
						The gravestone's forte is in calling tops. The shape of the gravestone doji makes its name appropriate. As we have discussed, 
						many of the Japanese technical terms are based on military analogies. In Japanese candlestick literature it is said that the 
						gravestone doji represents that gravestone of the bulls that have died defending their territory.
					</li>
					<li>
						As omnious as "gravestone" sounds, it does not imply a large move lower. While the gravestone doji, because of its extended

						decline. Canlde signals are unexcelled for spotting the early reversals, not to predict the extent of a move.

		area. In such a battle, we have to monitor the determination of the bulls. If this bullish scouting party can set up camp in enemy territory 
		(that is, close above resistance and maintain the new highs), then a beachhead is made. New, fresh bullish troops should join the scouting 
		party. The market should move up. As long as the beachhead is maintained (that is, the market holds above resistance), the bulls will have

	<h2>CANDLES WITH MOVING AVERAGES</h2>
	<p>
		The moving average is one of the oldest and most popular tools used by techniques. Its strength is as a trend-following device that 
		offers the trader the ability to catch major moves. Thus, it is utilized most effectively in trending markets.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>THE SIMPLE MOVING AVERAGE</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The most basic of the moving averages is the simple moving average. This is the average of all the price points used.			
		</li>
		<li>
			The general formula is:<br>(P1 + P2 + P3 + P4 + P5)/n<br>Where P1 = the most recent price<br>P2 = the second most recent price and so on<br>
			n = the number os data points
		</li>
		<li>
			The term "moving" in moving average is applicable because, as the newest data is added to the moving average, the oldest data is dropped. 
			Consequently, the average is always is always moving as the new data is added.
		</li>
		<li>
			The longer the moving average (n), the less effect an individual price will have on it.
		</li>
		<li>
			The shorter the term of the moving average, the closer it will "hug" prices. Thus us a plus insofar as it is more sensative to recent 
			price action. The neagtive aspect is that it has a greater potential for whipsaws. Longer-term moving averages provide a greater smoothing 
			effect, but are less responsive to recent prices.
		</li>
		<li>
			The spectrum of moving average users runs from intraday trader, who uses moving average of real-time trades, to the hedger, who may focus 
			on monthly, or even yearly, moving averages.
		</li>
		<li>
			Other than the length of the average, another avenue of analysis is based on what price is used to compute the average. Most moving average 
			systems use, as we did in our prior example, closing prices. However, moving averages of highs, lows, and the midpoint of the highs and lows 
			have all been used. Sometimes, even moving averages of moving averages are used. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2>THE WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE</h2>
	<p>
		A weighted moving average assigns a different weight to each price used to compute the average. Almost all weighted moving averages 
		are front loaded. That is, the most recent prices are weighted more heavily then older prices. How the data is weighted is a matter 
		of preference.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>THE EXPONENTIAL MOVING AVERAGE</h2>
	<P>
		The exponential moving average is a special type of weighted moving average. Like the basic weighted moving average, the exponential moving 
		average is front weighted. Unlike other moving averages, though, the exponential moving average incorporates all prior prices used in the data. 
		This type of moving average assigns progressively smaller weights to each of the past prices. Each weight is exponentially smaller than the 
		previous weight. hence, the name exponential moving average. One of the most popular uses of the exponential moving averages is fot the MACD. 
	</P>
	<hr>
	<h2>USING MOVING AVERAGES</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Moving averages can provide objective strategies with clearly defined trading rules. Many of the computerized technical trading systems 
			are underpinned on moving averages. Some of the common uses of the moving average include:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Comparing the price versus the moving averages as a trend indicator. For instance, a good gauge to see if a market is in an 
					intermediate-term uptrend could be that prices have to be above the 65-day moving average. For a longer-term uptrend, prices 
					would have to be higher than the 40-week moving average.
				</li>
				<li>
					Using the moving average as support or resistance levels. A close above the specified moving average would be bullish. A close 
					below the moving average would be bearish.
				</li>
				<li>
					Monitoring the moving average band (also known as envelopes). These bands are a certain percentage above or below the moving 
					average and can serve as support or resistance.
				</li>
				<li>
					Watching the slope of the moving average. For instance, if the moving average levels off or declines after a period of a sustained 
					rise, it may be a bearish signal. Drawing trend lines on the moving averages is a simple method of monitoring their slope.
				</li>
				<li>
					Trading with dual moving averages. One can compare a shorter-and longer-term moving average to each other. If the short-term moving 
					average crosses under the longer-term moving average, it would turn the trend down. In Japan, such a crossover is called a "dead 
					cross". When a shorter term moving average crosses over a long-term moving average, the Japanese refer to that as a "golden cross" 
					because it is viewed as a potentially bullish signal. Some traders will even take the dual moving averages s step further by saying 
					that for a trend to be higher, not only does the short-term moving average have to be over the long-term moving average, but the slope 
					of both moving averages must be up. 
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			The 30-day and shorter-term 5-day moving averages are good gauges for the equity markets.
		</li>
		<li>
			For futures, the 40- and 65-day moving averages are useful.
		</li>
		<li>
			They are not based on optimum moving averages. An optimum moving averages today might not be optimum one tomorrow. The length of the 
			moving averages used in the following examples are not the important point. What is meaningful is how moving averages can be melded 
			with candles. 
		</li>

			Unlike pattern recognition techniques that are subjective (this includes candlestick techniques), oscillators are mathematically derived 
			techniques that offer a more objective means of analyzing the market. They are widely used and are the basis of many computerized trading 
			systems.
		</li>
		<li>
			Oscillators include such technical tools as the relative strength index, stochastics, and MACD. The three major uses of the oscillators are:
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>As a divergence indicator</b> There are two kinds of divergence. A negative, or bearish, divergence occurs when prices are at a new 
					high, but the oscillator is not. This implies the market is internally weak. A positive, or bullish, divergence is when prices are 
					at a new low, but the oscillator does not hit a new low. The implication is that the selling pressure is losing steam.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>As overbought/oversold indicators</b> This means oscillators can notify the trader if the market has become overextended and, thus, 
					vulnerable to a correction.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>As confirmation of the force behind a trend's move</b> Oscillators can confirm the market's momemtum, measuring the velocity of a price 
					move by comparing price changes. In theory, the velocity should increase as the trend is under way. A flattening of momentum could be an 
					early warning that a price move may be decelerating.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			There is a Japanese saying: "All clouds do not rain". The oscillator is a rain cloud that has the potential for rain - but the only 
			way to tell it's raining is either seeing or feeling the raindrops. So it is with oscillators. An oscillator is like a storm cloud, but 
			we need a final confirmation with candle signals. An overbought or oversold oscillator is a warning, a cue, with final confirmation coming 
			with a candlestick pattern.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2>THE RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The RSI compares the relative strength of price advances to price declines over a specified period. Nine and 14 days are two of the most 
			popular periods used. The RSI is figured by comparing the gains of up sessions with the losses of the down sessions over a given time frame. 
			The calculations used are dependent only on closing prices. The formula is:<br>RSI = 100 - (100/(1 + RS))<br>where RS = average up points for 
			period / average down points for period.
		</li>
		<li>
			Thus, computing a 14-day RSI entails adding the total gains made on the up days over the last 14 days (on a close-to-close basis) and 
			dividing by 14. The same would be done for the down days. These figures provide the relative strength (RS). This RS is then put into 
			the RSI formula. This RSI formula converts the RS data so that it becomes an index with a range between 0 and 100.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>Using the RSI</b><br>The two main uses of RSI are as on overbought/oversold indicator and as a tool to monitor divergence.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			As an overbought / oversold indicator, the RSI implies that the market is overbought if it approaches the upper end of this band 
			(that is, above 70%). At this point, the market may be vulnerable to a pullback or could move into a period of consolidation. 
			Conversely, at the lower end of the RSI range (usually below 30%), it is said to reflect an oversold condition. In such an environment, 
			there is a potential of a short covering move.
		</li>
		<li>
			As a divergence tool, RSI calculations can be helpful when prices make a new high for the move and the RSI fails to make a concurrent 
			high. This is called negative divergence and is potentially bearish. Positive divergence occurs when prices make a new low, but the RSI 
			does not. Divergence is more meaningful when RSI oscillator readings are in overbought or oversold regions.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2>MOVING AVERAGE OSCILLATOR</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Computing the Moving Average Oscillator</b><br>
		This indicator is obtained by substracting the shorter-term moving average from the longer-term moving average. It has plus or minus values. 
		Thus, a value above 0 means the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average. A reading under 0 means the shorter-term 
		moving average is less than the longer-term moving average.<br>
		<b>Using the Moving Average Oscillator</b><br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Since this oscillator uses a short- and long-term moving average, we are comparing the short-term momentum to a longer-term momentum. This 
				is because the short-term moving average is more responsive to recent price activity. If the short-term moving average is relatively far 
				above (or below) the longer-term moving average, the market is said to be overbought (or oversold). As with the other oscillator, the moving 
				average oscillator is also used as a divergence vehicle.
			</li>
			<li>
				As prices increase, the technician wants to see the short-term moving average increase relative to the longer-term moving average. 
				This would mean increasing positive values for the moving average difference line. If prices advance and the difference between the 
				short- and long-term moving averages narrows, the market is indicating that the shorter-term momentum is running out of steam. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>STOCHASTICS (meaning involving a random variable)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The stochastic ocsillator us another popular tool. It, like all the other oscillators, provide overbought and oversold readings 
			and signals divergences. It also affords a mechanism to relate a shorter-term trend to a longer-term trend. The stochastic indicator 
			compares the latest closing price with the total range of the price action for a specified period. Stochastic values are between 0 
			and 100.
		</li>
		<li>
			A high stochastic reading would mean the close is near the upper end of the entire range for the period. A low reading means that the close 
			is near the low end fo the period's range. The idea behind stochastics is that as the market moves higher, closes trend to be near the highs 
			of the range; as the market moves lower, prices tend to cluster near the lows of the range.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>Computing Stochastics</b><br>
		The stochastic indicator is comprised of two lines: the %K and the %D. The %K line, called the raw stochastic or the fast %K, is more 
		sensative. The formula for the %K line is:<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((Close) - (low of N)) * 100 / ((High of N) - (Low of N)) = %K<br><br>
		&nbsp;Where Close = current close<br>
		&nbsp;Low of N = low of the range during the period used<br>
		&nbsp;High of N = high of the range during the period used<br>
		The "100" in the equation converts the value into a percentage. Thus, if the close today is the same as the high for the period under 
		observation, the fast %K would be 100%. A period can be in days, week, or even intraday (such as hourly). Fourteen, nineteen and 
		twenty-one periods are some of the more common periods.<br>
		Because the fast %K line can be so volatile, this line is usually smoothed by taking a 3-period moving average of %K is called the slow %K. 
		Most technicians use the slow %K line instead of the choppy fast %K line. This slow %K is then smoothened again using a 3-day moving average 
		of the slow %K to get what is called the %D line. This %D is essentially a moving average of a moving average. One way to think of the 
		difference between the %K and %D lines is too view them as you would two moving average, and the %D line comparable to a longer-term moving 
		average.<br><br>
		<b>Using Stochastic</b><br>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			As menationed preeviously, stochastics can be used in several ways. The most popular method is as a tool for showing divergence. Most 
			technicians who monitor stochastics use this aspect of divergence in conjunction with overbought/oversold readings.
		</li>
		<li>
			Some technicians require another rule: to have the slow %K line cross under the %D line for a sell signal, or for the slow %K to move 
			above the %D for a buy signal. This is comparable to the bullish (bearish) signal of a faster moving average crossing over (under) the 
			slower moving average.
		</li>
		<li>
			Another use is as a gauge for overbought/oversold. Most traders will view an 80% or higher reading as overbought, and 20% or lower 
			as oversold. For instance, to get a buy signal, the market must be oversold (20% or less for %D), there is positive divergence, and the 
			%K line is crossing above the %D line.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2>MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE-DIVERGENCE</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Constructing the MACD</b><br>
		While the Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) is composed of two lines, it is really a combination of three exponentially smoothed 
		moving averages.<br> 
		1. The first line is the differnece between two exponential moving averages (usually the 26- and 12-period exponential moving averages).<br>
		2. The second line of the MACD is made by taking an exponential moving average (usually 9-period) of the difference between the two 
		exponential moving averages used to make the first line.<br>
		The second line is called the signal line.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Using the MACD</b><br>
		When the faster line crosses above the slower (the signal line), it is viewed as a positive. A bearish crossover is when the faster line moves 
		under the slower line. The MACD can also be used to find areas in which the market is overbought or oversold. Because of the slower nature of 
		MACD, it is not generally used as a short-term trading tool.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>CANDLES WITH VOLUME</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			One of the most important clues sent out by the market is volume. Volume is like water pressure in a hose. The greater the water pressure, 
			the more powerful the water flow. Likewise, the stronger the volume, the more force behind the move.
		</li>
		<li>
			Volume should increase in the the dirrection of the trend to improve the likelihood that the current trend should continue. If, however, 
			volume declines as a trend progresses, there is less reason to believe the trend will continue. Volume can also be useful for confirming 
			tops and bottoms.
		</li>
		<li>
			Because volume numbers are differnet from market to market, so we don't look at an absolute volume figure, but at relative volume. In other 
			words, in one stock 50,000 could be an extraordinarily high-volume session - while, in another, 10 million shares might be light volume. As 
			such, we look for relative volume spikes in a market.
		</li>
		<li>
			One interesting aspect, a very long shadow hammer means that by the time the hammer is confirmed (we need to wait for a close to confrim 
			the hammer), the market could be well off its lows. Buying at the close of such a hammer may not present an attractive risk/reward since 
			the market may retrace back to the lows of the hammer before, potentially, resuming an upward course. A high-volume hammer decreases the 
			chance for a correction to the hammer's low. Therefore, one may be more aggressive about buying on the hammer's close if it is a usually 
			high-volume hammer than one would if the volume didn't give the same forceful confirmation.
		</li>
		<li>
			With the piercing pattern, we would like to see lighter volume on the black candle and heavier volume on the white candle. 
			This would serve to reinforce that the bears are loosing force and the bulls are gaining a strong foothold. This volume 
			scenario also increases the odds that the piercing pattern will hold.
		</li>
		<li>
			The significance of the bearish engulfing pattern will increase if there is a lighter volume on the first candle (the white) and a 
			heavier volume on the second candle (the black).
		</li>
		<li>
			Adding the insights of volume to the power of a falling or rising window is, as the Japanese proverb says, "Like the right hand helping 
			the left". While a rising window is viewed as potential support, a high-volume window enhances its effectiveness as support (or, in the 
			case of falling window, as resistance).
		</li>
		<li>
			While a small real body is a clue that a decline or advance may be exhausing itself, if we add high volume to a small real body, we get 
			more substantiation of a turn.
		</li>
		<li>
			To summarize integrating high volume with spinning tops or doji:
			<ol>
				<li>
					An unusually high-volume doji or spinning top after an extended advance illustrates that the bulls' drive is beaing met with 
					enough supply to stall the rally. This is a possible top reversal.
				</li>
				<li>
					A very heavy-volume doji or small real body during a steep decline shows that heavy supply is being taken by the equally aggressive 
					demand.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			Whether there is a single candle line or a group of candles forming a pattern, the chances of a turnaround are increased if volume confirms 
			what the candle pattern is showing. 
		</li>
		<li>
			As a general rule we can say that the longer the white candle, the more probable a continuation of a rally. But volume adds another important 
			dimension to this. When a market creates a new high, we would like to see that confirmed by a push in volume. There are cases where the volume 
			won't corroborate the breakout. Although lack of volume on an upside breakout wouldn't convert from a bull to a bear, it is a reason to be more 
			unwillingness to take risks. Thus is bacause such a low-volume rally increases the chances that is will not be sustained. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2>MEASURED MOVES</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Candle charts, because they provide an x-ray into the demand/supply situation, are potent in calling early turning signals. Assuming 
			one enters a trade with a candle signal (preferably with confirmation with other candle or Wesitern signals), the challange becomes 
			knowing when to exit.
		</li>
		<li>
			One of the methods is forecasting price objectives from classic Western patterns. There is another reason for incorporating mearused 
			targets. No matter how ideal a candle pattern or ho many reversal signals converge at one area, it doesn't predict the extent of the 
			reversal. This is where we shift to Western technicals for price objectives.
		</li>
		<li>
			The measuring techniques illustrated here include breakouts from box range, swing targets, flags and pennants, and ascending and 
			descending triangles.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2>BREAKOUTS FROM BOXES</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Most of the time, the markets are not in a trending mode but rather in a lateral range, what the Japanese call a box range. 
						On such accasions, the market is in relative state of harmony with neither the bulls nor the bears in charge. The Japanese 
						word for tranquility and calm is "wa". Markets that are bounded in a box range as being in a state of "wa".
					</li>
					<li>
						When a market is in a box, it is like a coiled spring ready to unwind when the surrounding pressure is released. We can use 
						this potential pent-up energy. When a breakout from box range unfolds, the market has good potential continuing in the 
						dirrection of the breakout.
					</li>
					<li>
						As shown in the exhibit (the figures on the right-side of this section), a move outside the box implies a move at least equal 
						to the vertical height of the box (bullish breakout), one takes the vertical measurement from the bottom end of the box (the 
						support area) to the top end of the box range (the previous resistance). The distance is shown as A-B. We derive a target by 
						adding this A-B range onto the prior resistance area. As an example, an upside breakout from a $50-$53 box range would give 
						a $56 target.
					</li>
					<li>
						The opposite would be a penetration of ths box range's support (shown as a bearish breakout in the exhibit in this section). If 
						we used the same $50-$53 box range, a bearish break of this support at $50 would provide a $47 target.
					</li>

	<h2>SWING TARGETS, FLAGS, AND PENNANTS</h2>
	<p>Swing targets, flags, and pennants are comprised of three segments:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			An initial cleanly defined brisk move.
		</li>
		<li>
			A correction of the move.
		</li>
		<li>
			A resumption of the move in the same direction as the initial move.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The theory behind the swing target (shown in the exhibit on the right side) is that if market advances, or declines, 
						vigorously, and then there is a retracement of this move, the next leg of the move should be at least equal to the move 
						of the previous channel. 
					</li>
					<li>
						This is shown in the figure on this right of this section where the height of the first leg is a rally from A to B. There 
						is then a correction to C. Once the market ascends from C, we would "swing" the initial channel height of A to B onto the 
						corrrection low at C. Hence, the name "swing target".
					</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<img src="swing-target.png" alt="Swing Targets">
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Swing targets are very similar in concept to flags and pennants. The major difference is that corrections in a swing target 
						are more substantial than flags or pennants. As shown in the exhibit, flags are lateral, ar small countertrend, moves after 
						a clearly defined sharp advance or decline. This congestion band serves to relieve an overbought (in a rally) or oversold (in 
						a decline) condition. If, after this short-term correction, the market resumes its prior trend, we then have a flag or pennant 
						pattern.
					</li>
					<li>
						The difference between flags and pennants is that in a flag, the "flag" portion is a horizontal box range. In a pennant pattern, 
						the "flag" portion (i.e., the congestion band) looks like a pennant because it has lower highs and higher lows.
					</li> 
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<img src="bull-flag-and-pennant.png" alt="Bull Flag and Pennant">
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Exhibits Bull Flag and Pennant & Bear Flag and Pennant show the measurements of the bull and bear flag and pennants. Their 
						measuring implications are built on the same concept as that of the swimg target. For the flag or pennant pattern, we use 
						the vertical height of the initial advance or decline - nicknamed the "flagpole".
					</li>
					<li>
						In the Exhibit Bull Flag and Pennant we see bull flag and pennant's price targets are derived by adding the height of the 
						initial sharp advance (the flagpole) from A to B onto the bottom end of the congestion band (which is either a flag or pennant 
						shape). The more traditional method is adding this flagpole's height to the top of the flag or pennant. We may want to make a 
						mistake by exiting too early rather than missing the last few few ticks. As such the measurement starts from the bottom of the 
						flag or pennant rather than the top.
					</li>
					<li>
						As shown in Exhibit Bear Flag and Pennant, the bear flag or pennant objective is forecasted by substracting the flagpole (A-B) 
						range from the top of the congestion band. (Again, this is a subjective conservative target - others will use the more classic 
						measurement from the bottom of the congestion band).

				<ul>
					<li>
						There are many types of triangles in Western technicals: symmetrical triangles, wedges, and so on. As shown in the 
						Exhibits, there are ascending and descending triangles.
					</li>
					<li>
						The ascending triangle has a horizontal resistance area tested numerous times. Moves down from this resistance are at 
						sequentially higher lows. This exemplifies that, although there is supply at the resistance line, demand is getting more 
						aggressive as the market pulls back from this resistance area. If the bulls can then push the market over the horizontal 
						resistance, we have an ascending triangle. The measuremant is the height from the horizzontal resistance area (A) to the 
						widest part of the triangles (at B) added to the just-broken resistance area.
					</li>
					<li>
						The descending triangle is a pattern wherein a horizontal support area is successfully defended, but each rally from there 
						meets with successively lower highs. These lower highs rflect how the bears are keeping the bulls well in check. With a 
						penetration of support, we take the wildest point of the descending triangle and add that measurement from the prior support 
						line.
