	<h1>JAPANESE CANDLESTICK CHARTING TECHNIQUE</h1>
	<p>
		The term "candlesticks" also called "candles" is a Japanese chart
		analysis technique that has been refined by generations of use in
		the Far East. Until 1991, the technique reamined secret from the
		Western world for over a century because no document ever mentioned
		about it. But, now it is known and accepted worldwide. Some of the
		features of this technique are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Easy to understand</li>
		<li>Provide earlier indications of the market turns and reversal
			signals</li>
		<li>Furnish unique market insights by showing the underpinning
			move</li>
		<li>Enjoyable to learn</li>
		<li>Applicable to any market be it Eastern or Western and enhances
			analysis</li>
		<li>Increases the effeciency of analysis by sending visual
			information</li>
		<li>Based on psychology of market - considers sentiments of
			traders</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>The basics of candlesticks</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Candle - </b>A candle has a real body which is the rectangular 
		section and thin lines above and below the real body called shadows. 
		The top and the bottom sections of the rectangular body represents 
		the open and the close values and the tips of shadows represent 
		the high and the low values. Because of their shape these are 
		called candles. Candles can be drawn using any time frame- from 
		intraday to daily to weekly charts and so on. Multiple variants 
		of candle are shown below:
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 25%;">
				<p>
					<b> The white candle - </b> when the close value is greater 
					the open value then this is depicted as a white candle.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is also called bulls.
				</p>
			</td>
			<td style="width: 25%;">

					<img src="White-candle-chart.png" alt="White candle">
					<p><u>White candle</u></p>
				</center>
			</td>
			<td style="width: 25%;">
				<p>
					<b> The black candle - </b> when the open value is greater 
					the close value then this is depicted as a black candle.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is also called bears.
				</p>
			</td>

					<p><u>Black candle</u></p>
				</center>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>
		<b>Shaven head- </b>If a candle has no upper shadow, it is said 
		to have shaven head. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Shaven bottom- </b>A candle with no lower shadow has a shaven 
		bottom. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Spinning top- </b>The japanese term for a small real body 
		(black or white) is a spinning top.
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<b>Doji- </b>When there are no real body i.e. when the 
				open and close values are really close then the candles 
				representing these are called doji. Doji have implications 
				as a reversal signal.

		</tr>
	</table>
	<h2>Trend reversal</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<p>
					Trend reversal means that the prior trend is about to
					end. This is shown in the figure on the right side of 
					this section. The indicators have indicated that the upward
					movement is about to end. And now one of the three situation
					may happen:
					<ul>
						<li>
							The price will continue to move up a bit and then it 
							will move down.
						</li>
						<li>
							The price will move down and after reaching a point, it 
							will rise again.
						</li>
						<li>
							The price will fall and continue to fall.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Trend reversal is just a caution indicator. The market's
					psychology is in transformation.

	<h2>UMBRELLA LINES</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Candles with long lower shadows and small real bodies 
						(black or white) near the top of the range. These are 
						called umbrella lines because they look like umbrellas.
					</li>
					<li>
						These umbrella lines can be either bullish or bearish 
						according to the market environment. The character of 
						umbrella lines chnages based on the prevailing trend before 
						the umbrella lines.
					</li>
					<li>
						If an umbrella line emerges during a downtrend, it is 
						a signal that the downtrend should end. In such a scenario, 
						this umbrella line is labeled a <b>hammer</b>, as in "the 
						market is hammering out" a base.
					</li>
					<li>
						The actual Japanese word for the hammer is <b>takuri</b>.
						The hammer line looks like a hammer with its head and handle.
						The hammer's long lower shadow and the close at, or near, the 
						high of the session graphically relays that the market sold off 
						sharply during the session and then bounced back to close at, or 
						near, the session's high. this could have bullsih ramifications. 
						This aspect of closing at or near highs is why the hammer should 
						have no, or a miniscule, upper shodow. If there was a long upper 
						shadow, this would mean the market closed well off its highs, 
						which is an important criterion for the hammer. A lower shadow 
						is necessary because it would display that the market had been 
						pushed downsharply lower during the session, but by the end 
						of the session, there was a "kamikaze fight" as the bears lost 
						controlas adduced by the fact that the market closed at, or near, 
						its session highs.
					</li>
					<li>
						If either of lines emerges after a rally, it is a potential 
						top reversal signal called <b>a hanging man</b>. The name 
						"hanging man" is derived from the fact that it looks like a 
						hanging man with dangling legs. It has the same shape as the 
						hammer. The only difference is that a hanging man comes after 
						an advance. A close beneath the hanging man is preffered. 
						<u>It is advisable to wait for bearish confirmation after 
							a hanging man.</u>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The hammer and hanging man can be recognized by three 
					criteria:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The real body is at the upper end of the trading range.
						The colour of the rel body is not important.
					</li>
					<li>
						It has a long lower shadow that hsould be at least twice 
						the height of the real body.
					</li>
					<li>
						It should have no, or a very short, upper shadow.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p> 
					There are three aspects that differentiate the hanging man 
					from hammer- trend, extent of the move before the candle line,
					and the confirmation.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Trend: </b>A hammer must come after a decline. A hanging man
						must come after a rally.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Extent of the move before the candle line: </b>A hammer is valid
						even if it comes after a short-term decline, but a hanging man should
						emerge after an extended rally, preferably at an all-time high.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Confirmation: </b>A hanging man should be confirmed, while a 
						hammer need not be.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The longer the lower shadow, the shorter the upper shadow; the 
					smaller the real body, the more meaningful the bullish hammer or 
					bearish hanging man.

	<h2>THE ENGULFING PATTERN</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Most candle signals are based on combinations of 
						individual candle lines. The engulfing pattern is 
						the first of these multiple candle line patterns.
					</li>
					<li>
						The engulfing pattern is a major reversal signal 
						with two opposite colour real bodies composing a 
						pattern.
					</li>
					<li>
						Another name for the engulfing patter is a "hugging 
						line".
					</li>
					<li>
						The figure shown on the right (above) of this section 
						shows <b>a bullish	englufing pattern</b>. The market 
						is falling. And then a white bullish real body wraps 
						around, or engulfs, the prior period's black real body. 
						This shows buying pressure has over-whelmed selling 
						pressure.
					</li>
					<li>
						The figure shown on the right (below) of this section 
						shows <b>a bearish engulfing pattern</b>. Here the 
						market is trending higher. A white real body engulfed 
						by a black real body is the signal for a top reversal. 
						This also shows that supply has overwhelmed demand.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ol>
					There are three criteria for an engulfing pattern:
					<li>
						The market has to be in a clearly definable uptrend 
						(for a bearish engulfing pattern) or downtrend ( for
						a bullish englufing pattern), even if the trend is 
						short term.
					</li>
					<li>
						Two candles comprise the engulfing pattern. The second 
						real body must engulf the prior real body (it need not 
						engluf the shadows).
					</li>
					<li>
						The second real body of the engulfing pattern should be 
						the opposite colour of the first real body. The exception 
						to this rule is if the first real body of the engulfing 
						pattern is a doji. Thus, after an extended fall, a doji 
						engulfed by a very large white real body could be a bottom 
						reversal. In an uptrend, a doji enveloped by a very large 
						black real body could be a bearish reversal pattern.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					Some factors increasing the likelihood that an engulfing 
					pattern could be an important turning signal are:
					<li>
						If the first day of the engulfing pattern has a very small 
						real body (i.e., a spinning top) and the second day has a 
						very long real body. The small first real body candle 
						reflects a dissipation of the prior trend's force and the 
						large second real body proves an increase in the force 
						behind the new move.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the engulfing pattern appears after a protracted or very 
						fast move. A fast or extended move creates an overextended 
						market (either overbought or oversold) and makes it vulnerable 
						to profit taking.
					</li>
					<li>
						If there is heavy volume on the second real body of the 
						engulfing pattern. 
					</li>
				</ol>

		<li>
			A prime use of the engulfing pattern is utilizing them as support 
			or resistance. Provided we need to wait for the close.
		</li>
		<li>
			On the right hand side of the figure shown above, the high of the 
			two candle lines that make the bearish engulfing pattern. That high 
			becomes our resistance (based on a close).
		</li>
		<li>
			This technique of the bearish engulfing pattern as resistance is 
			especially useful if the market has moved too far from the highs 
			to be comfortable selling. 
		</li>
		<li>
			On the left hand side of the figure shown above, the same concept is 
			used for bullish engulfing pattern. The lowest low of this pattern 
			becomes support.

		<li>
			This technique of the bullish engulfing pattern as support is 
			especially useful if the market has moved too far from the lows 
			to be comfortable buying (consider correction as well).

	<h2>DARK-CLOUD COVER</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
					<li>
						It is a reversal pattern. It is a dual-candle pattern 
						that is a top reversal after an uptrend or, at times, 
						at the top of a congestion band.
					</li>
					<li>
						The first day of this two-candel pattern is a strong white 
						real body. The second day's price opens above the prior 
						session's high (that is, above the top of the upper shadow).
						However, by the end of the second day's session, the market 
						closes deeply within the prior day's white body. 
					</li>
					<li>
						The greater the degree of penetration into the white body, the 
						more likely this is a top. <u>Some Japanese technicians require 
						more than a 50-percent penetration of the black session's close 
					    into the white real body.</u> 
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>If the black candles does not close below the halfway point 
						of the white candlestick, it may be best to wait for more 
						bearish confirmation following the dark-cloud cover.</b> 
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>In some cases it is considered as a 
						dark-cloud cover even if the open is over the prior session's 
					    close instead of the prior session's high.</u>
					</li>
					<li>
						The rationale behind this bearish pattern is readily explained. 
						On the first session of the dark-cloud cover, the market is 
						ascending with a strong white candel. This is followed by a gap 
						higher on the next session's opening. Thus far, the bulls are in 
						complete control. But then the whole technical picture changes as, 
						on the second day of this pattern, the market closed not only 
						beneath the prior close, but well within the prior day's real body, 
						offsetting much of the gain of the first session. In such scenario, 
						the longs will have second thoughts about their position.
					</li>
					<li>
						Those who were waiting for selling short now have a benchmark to 
						place a stop <u>at the new high of the second day of the dark-cloud 
						cover pattern</u>.
					</li>
