	<h2>Financial Education</h2>
	<h3>Chapter 1 - Introduction</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Financial education helps people in being financially literate and develop a positive attitude towards
			managing their income, expenditure, assets and liabilities properly, which would lead them to a situation of
			better financial well-being.
		</li>
		<li>
			Financial planning goes beyond savings. It is an investment with a purpose. It is a plan to save and spend
			future income and should be carefully budgeted.
		</li>
		<li>
			This literature provides a fair understanding of the personal finance world, explaining the concept of
			financial planning, key concepts in financial literacy, various investment options, savings and investment
			products, insurance and pension products, retirement planning, caution against Ponzi schemes, tax saving
			options, investor protection measures, do’s and don’ts of investing, etc.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 2 - Key Concepts in personal finance</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Savings are the surplus of income over expenditure.
		</li>
		<li>
			People usually meet their short term goals with savings. Money in savings account of a bank earns a small
			amount of interest and it is easy to withdraw it whenever needed. People can save in savings bank accounts,
			Post Office savings accounts, etc. Low risk instruments.
		</li>
		<li>
			Investment is the act of deployment of money out of savings into financial or non-financial products with
			the expectation of earning higher returns over a period of time.
		</li>
		<li>
			The various products in which investments may be done are financial products viz. fixed deposit in bank,
			buying shares in stock market, investing in Mutual funds, etc. and non-financial products viz. purchase of
			land, gold, silver, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			The investments may be done for short term, medium term or long-term. While investing one should always
			remember that return on investments may rise or fall over time and it is quite normal for that to happen.
		</li>
		<li>
			Items that you own and have economic value are your assets and items which you owe to others or have
			borrowed from others are your liabilities.
		</li>
		<li>
			Money borrowed to meet shortfall of money when expenses are more than the funds available in hand is called
			debt.
		</li>
		<li>
			The time value of money shows that time literally is money, i.e. the value of the money you have now is not
			the same as it will be in the future and vice versa.
		</li>
		<li>
			Inflation refers to rise in prices of goods and services. Over a period of time, as the cost of goods and
			services increases, the ability of a unit of money, say one rupee, to buy goods and services keeps
			declining. In other words, the Purchasing Power of money, i.e. ability of money to buy anything, decreases.
			It is important to take into account the effects of inflation on your investments during financial planning.
			Investors greatly fear inflation since it reduces the value of their investment.
		</li>
		<li>
			This increase in the price is not as a result of higher quantity or a better quality of the end-product, but
			due to inflation impacting the prices of the ingredients and finally the end product.
		</li>
		<li>
			To reduce the risk of decrease in the value of money, you can invest the money available to you today at a
			rate equal or higher than the rate of inflation.
		</li>
		<li>
			Power of Compounding - With simple interest, you can earn interest only on the principal (that is, the
			amount you initially invested); while with compounding interest, you earn interest on the principal as well
			as, previously earned interest.
		</li>
		<li>
			Rupee cost averaging (for example, Mutual Funds) is the process in which you invest a fixed amount of money
			at regular intervals irrespective of market fluctuations. For example, you buy more units when unit prices
			are low and less units when unit prices are high. By investing according to a schedule, you avoid the
			complex or even impossible duty of trying to figure out the exact best time to invest. The rupee cost
			averaging effect averages out the costs of your units and hence lessens the impact of short-term market
			fluctuations on your investments.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 3 - Financial Planning</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>A. Financial planning </b>is the process of estimating financial needs of a person and implementing a
			comprehensive plan to meet those financial needs during his or her lifetime through investment. For
			instance, birth of a child, education, purchasing house, marriage, meeting emergency situations like an
			illness, to meet the impact of an accident, death, or natural calamities like flood, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>B. Financial Planning process</b>
			<ol type="1">
				<li>Determine current financial position</li>
				<li>Identify & Set your finaicial goals</li>
				<li>Identify suitable investment avenues</li>
				<li>Evaluate alternatives & strategize</li>
				<li>Create & Implement your financial action plan</li>
				<li>Review and revise the financial plan</li>
			</ol>
			1-2-3-4-5-6-1-2-- so on...
		</li>
		<li>
			Determine your current financial situation - You need to understand what your incomes, expenses, assets and
			liabilities/debts are? Your net worth is simply assets you own minus liabilities you owe.
		</li>
		<li>
			Your net worth indicates your capacity to achieve your financial goals, such as buying a home, paying for
			university education, future medical expenses, repayment of loan, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			Develop Financial Goals - Your financial goals can range from acquiring assets, saving for emergency as well
			as making investments for your future financial security. The financial goals of an individual can be
			categorized as below:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Basic financial goals (food, clothing, shelter, etc.)</li>
				<li>Secondary or advanced financial goals (education, house, marriage, etc.)</li>
				<li>Retirement planning</li>
				<li>Estate planning</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			Individuals can use a variety of investment, risk management and tax planning strategies to meet their
			financial goals. These goals change over an individual's lifetime and accordingly the financial plan should
			be reviewed on a regular basis for any modification as per change in the circumstances.
		</li>
		<li>
			While making financial plans, one should first ensure a planned savings amount and then plan for meeting
			expenses. <br>
			Mr. Warren Buffett, one of world’s successful investor, has said: - “Don’t save what is left after spending;
			spend what is left after saving.” <br>
			Therefore, the basic concept that everyone should focus upon while utilising his income is as follows: <br>
			Income – Savings = Expenditure
		</li>
		<li>
			Wealth is not built overnight. One needs to set specific financial goals. A good financial goal should be
			SMART i.e. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound.

			Goal-based investing focuses on meeting goals that are personal and specific. The focus of this approach is
			to arrive at future value of different goals and then pursuing these goals through asset allocation made for
			investments according to each individual’s financial goal. To adopt this strategy while investing, one must
			plan as per one's age, risk appetite (ability to take risk), financial situation and investment horizon.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Five-Step Approach to Achieve Financial Goals</b>
			<p>Step-1: Identify specific financial goals</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is important to prepare a proper plan to fix each investment with a specific goal.</li>
				<li>It is very important to identify one’s financial goals and aspirations and estimate the amount of
					money it would be needed to fulfil them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Step-2: Classify goals into Short-term, Medium term or Long term</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Short-term goals</b> are typically financial requirements that are expected to arise in time
					period ranging from a few months to one year.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Medium-term goals</b> may have a time horizon of one year to eight years. Goals like buying a
					property, starting your own venture, getting enrolled in a professional course, etc. can be
					medium-term financial goals.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Long-term goals</b> may have a time horizon of eight years or more for example child's marriage,
					retirement planning, etc.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Step-3: Decide upon asset-allocation</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Asset-Allocation is a strategy for investing your money into various asset classes such as equity
					and debt that would suit an investor's income and risk appetite.
				</li>
				<li>
					Asset Classes may be referred to groups of financial instruments which have similar financial
					characteristics.
				</li>
				<li>
					Asset Allocation refers to an investment strategy that aims to balance risk and reward - in the form
					of returns - by dividing the assets of an individual’s portfolio according to his/her financial
					goals, risk tolerance and investment horizon.
				</li>
				<li>
					Allocate assets depending on your age, lifestyle, family commitments and your financial goals.
				</li>
				<li>
					While allocating your funds, distribute your investments across various asset classes such as
					equity, bonds, real estate, etc., to benefit from diversification, which helps reduce risk and
					increases the possibility of earning moderate to high returns on your investments.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Step-4: Choose the right investment with diversification (within asset classes)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Arriving at the right risk-return combination and choosing the right asset allocation can seem
					difficult. For a longer term goal, it is advisable to focus on maximizing returns with diversified
					asset allocation.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Diversification- </b>refers to the process which reduces risk by making investments into various
					financial instruments, industries and other categories. It aims to minimize loss on return by
					investing in different asset classes (debt, equity, gold, real assets, etc.) that would react
					differently to the same event, such as those relating to the economy or markets.
				</li>
				<li>
					Although diversification does not provide guarantee against loss, it is the most important component
					for reaching long-term financial goals while minimizing risk.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Step-5: Review and revise financial plans</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To stay on track, regularly review the progress towards your goals and investments.</li>
				<li>Review your investments like stocks and mutual funds in your portfolio. Certain products may seem
					tailor-made for specific needs, but they may not be actually useful for one's portfolio.</li>
				<li>Be aware of such investment options.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>C. Choosing Investment Options & Understanding Risk</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The investment products available for an investor are fixed income securities, equity investments,
					mutual funds, etc. Every asset class has its own risk and return.
				</li>
				<li>
					Investments in equities are considered as high risk investments as their returns are subject to
					performance of individual companies and general economic scenario.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the other hand, investments in the debt instruments are considered having relatively low risk.
				</li>
				<li>
					For instance, Government bonds are considered to be effectively "risk free" due to the trust that
					government will not default on the repayment to investors.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Three pillars of investment - </b>The investment decision by an individual is influenced by
					safety, liquidity and return. They are called the three pillars of investment.
					<ul type="a">
						<li>
							<b>Safety: </b>This is about how well protected the principal and return on the investment
							is. For instance, if you lend ₹100/- to someone, will it be repaid on time? Or, is your
							capital of ₹100/- safe? Safety means your money invested is protected and there is every
							possibility that on the agreed date, or maybe even before, it would be returned whenever
							needed.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Liquidity: </b>This pillar of investment is the degree of ease with which you can en-cash
							or liquidate your investment at fair value. In the above example, it will be about how soon
							will you get your money back if you need it immediately?
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Return: </b>What is the return you will get on your investments? It could be in the form
							of income, appreciation of capital invested or both. Income means an investment's earnings
							in the form of interest or dividend payment. Capital appreciation means the increase in
							market value of investment over a period of time.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>D. Returns from Investment</b><br>
			Returns from Investment can be described as money made by an investor on his/ her investment. The returns
			can be in two ways as explained below:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Regular Income</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Equity Investment: </b>You get dividend when you buy and hold equity shares of a company
							and units of equity mutual fund.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Fixed Income Investment: </b>In debt securities, you receive fixed interest on interest
							bearing Investments
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Capital Appreciation</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							When the value of initial investment increases over a period of time and the investor
							benefits by selling part or whole of the investment at the increased value,<b> it is called
								Capital Appreciation.</b>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>E. What are Risks and Returns?</b><br>
			Risk can be defined as the probability or likelihood of a loss occurring in relation to your expected
			returns from any particular investment. It is a measure of the level of uncertainty of achieving the returns
			as per investor expectations.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Risk V/S Return</b><br>
					Risk and investing go hand in hand. The good news is that "risk" comes with the potential for
					"rewards" from investing — which is what makes the whole process worthwhile.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 4. Savings Related Products</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Deposit schemes offered by banks, government deposit schemes, public deposits issued by companies, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>A. Why to keep money in banks?</b><br>
			Drawbacks of keeping cash at home are mentioned as below:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Unsafe –</b> Money can be stolen or lost due to natural calamities</li>
				<li><b>Loss of growth opportunities -</b> Loss of interest income</li>
				<li><b>No/Low credit eligibility -</b> Deposit in banks creates eligibility for taking loans</li>
			</ul>
			Therefore, it is beneficial to keep money in banks rather than at home in cash.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>B. Banking</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Commercial banks are regulated financial institutions as they deal with public money and trust.
				</li>
				<li>
					Commercial banks in India are regulated by Reserve Bank of India. Banks are required to go through
					mandatory inspection and audits at various intervals and are also audited by the Reserve Bank of
					India every year.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bank deposits are comparatively lower risk investments. Banks offer various types of deposits,
					depending on the needs of the customers.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bank deposits are preferred more for their liquidity and safety than for the returns. It is also
					possible to get loans from banks against fixed deposits up to 75 to 90 % of the deposit amount.
				</li>
				<li>
					Central Government deposit insurance scheme ensures that all deposits are insured by the Government
					up to a limit of ₹5 lakhs per customer in that particular bank. So, even in case of a failure of a
					bank, depositors are assured that the Government will step in and return up to ₹5 lakhs of their
					savings in that bank.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>C. Account Opening Process — Know Your Client (KYC) Norms</b><br>

				<li>
					For opening any type of bank account, customers need to undergo the process of complying with KYC
					norms. KYC Stands for "Know Your Customer".
				</li>
				<li>
					The objective of KYC is to enable banks to know and understand their customers better and help them
					manage their risks prudently.
				</li>
				<li>
					The KYC documents generally accepted by banks are: Photograph, Document for proof of identity (copy
					of PAN Card, Aadhaar Card, etc.) and Document for proof of address (copy of electricity bill,

	<h3>Chapter 5 - Investment in Securities Market</h3>
	<ul>
		Types of Risks:
		<ol type="1">
			<li>
				<b>Market risk or Systematic Risks- </b>An investor may experience losses due to factors affecting the
				overall performance of financial markets and macroeconomic factors. Stock market bubbles and crashes are
				good examples of heightened market risk.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Unsystematic Risk- </b>Unsystematic risk can be described as the uncertainty inherent in a particular
				company or industry. Examples of unsystematic risk include a new competitor in the marketplace with the
				potential to take significant market share from the company an investor is invested in, a regulatory
				change, such as one that could drive down company sales, a shift in management, a product recall, etc.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Inflation risk- </b>Inflation risk, also called as purchasing power risk, is the chance that the cash
				flows from an investment won't be worth as much in the future as they are today because of a decline in
				its purchasing power due to inflation.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Liquidity risk -</b>Liquidity risk arises when an investment cannot be bought or sold or converted
				into cash quickly enough to prevent or minimize a loss or to meet any immediate expense. You can
				minimize this risk to a great extent by diversifying your investments.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Business Risk- </b>It refers to the risk that a business might stop its operations due to any
				unfavourable market or financial situation.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Volatility Risk- </b>It refers to the risk when the stock prices of a company may fluctuate, even
				when those companies aren't in danger of failing.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Currency Risk- </b>Currency risk arises when there is a possibility of losing money due to
				unfavourable movements in exchange rates. It may happen from change in price of one currency in relation
				to other and investors who have assets across national borders are exposed to this risk.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<li>
			<b>How to mitigate the risk?</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Asset allocation is one strategy through which an investor can benefit from diversification of their
					investments into various sectors and companies to mitigate risk.
				</li>
				<li>
					Volatility risk can be managed by investing through Systematic Investment Plan of Mutual Funds or
					buying equities directly from the market in smaller lots over a period of time.
				</li>
				<li>
					A good understanding of the fundamentals of a company can help one make an appropriate judgment
					about the health of a company.
				</li>
				<li>
					Of course, investors should ignore the rumours and unsolicited messages for investing in securities
					market.
				</li>
				<li>
					Investments in securities market are done through primary market as well as secondary market. The
					difference between primary market and secondary market is that in the primary market, investors are
					allotted securities directly by the company, while in the secondary market investors buy securities
					from the existing investors through their stock brokers. Investments in securities market are
					subject to taxation, which includes short term and long term tax on capital gains as well as
					dividend pay-outs.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>What are the pre-requisites to invest in securities?</b><br>
			In order to invest in equity shares, an investor should have three accounts:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Savings Account –</b>Saving bank account with a commercial bank
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Trading Account - </b>Trading account with a SEBI registered stock broker of a recognized stock
					exchange to buy or sell securities on the Stock Exchange
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Demat Account -</b> Demat account with a SEBI recognized Depository Participant (DP) of
					Depository for holding securities in dematerialized/electronic form. The Demat account can be opened
					with depository participant (DP) of any of the Depository. National Securities Depository Ltd.
					(NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Ltd. (CDSL) are two SEBI registered depositories in
					India.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Primary Market</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					When a company publicly issues new stocks and bonds for the first time, it does so in the primary
					market. In many cases, this takes the form of an initial public offer (IPO).
				</li>
				<li>
					SEBI examines the prospectus issued to the public for subscription of shares to see that it meets
					with the requirements of the SEBI Regulations.
				</li>
				<li>
					Companies issuing securities via the primary market hire merchant bankers who, on behalf of the
					company, prepare the prospectus and ensure related compliance for the issue of shares viz.
					finalization of allotment process, listing of shares in the stock exchanges, etc.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) for Shares</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					An investor can now apply for shares in the primary market through ASBA. In public issues w.e.f. May
					01, 2010 all the investors can apply through ASBA.
				</li>
				<li>
					ASBA is an application by an investor containing an authorization to the bank to block the
					application money in his/ her bank account, for subscribing to an issue.
				</li>
				<li>
					Blocked amount continues to earn interest. If an investor is applying through ASBA, his application
					money shall be debited from the bank account only if his/her application is selected for allotment,
					after the basis of allotment is finalized.
				</li>
				<li>
					The investor need not have to bother about refunds as money to the extent required for allotment of
					securities, is deducted from the bank account and in case the securities are not allotted to the
					investor, then the blocked amount in his/ her bank account is released and made available to use.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Unified Payment Interface (UPI) in ASBA</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A new feature of utilizing Unified Payment Interface (UPI) while making payment in ASBA, has also
					been introduced recently.
				</li>
				<li>
					This feature may be used for the purpose of blocking of funds and making payments in the public
					issue process.
				</li>
				<li>
					This requires the investors to create a UPI ID and PIN using any of the UPI enabled mobile
					application. Usage of UPI in public issue process brings in comfort, ease of use and reduces the
					listing time for public issues.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Secondary Market</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Secondary market is the market where securities are traded after the company has issued the stocks
					and bonds in the primary market.
				</li>
				<li>
					The shares are listed and traded on the stock exchanges which facilitates the buying and selling of
					stocks in the secondary market.
				</li>
				<li>
					Major SEBI recognized stock exchanges in India are BSE Ltd. (formerly Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd.)
					and the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE).
				</li>
				<li>
					Anyone can purchase securities on the secondary market as long as they are willing to pay the price
					at which the securities are being traded.
				</li>
				<li>
					Investment in securities market should be done after carrying out research on the background of the
					company, future prospects and financial strength of the company.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Know Your Client (KYC)</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					For the purpose of opening of Demat and trading account with a Depository Participant (DP)/Stock
					broker, the investor has to complete Know Your Client (KYC) process with the respective DP/Stock
					Broker.
				</li>
				<li>
					KYC is mandatory under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 and Rules framed there under.
					Investor has to submit Officially Valid Documents (OVDs) as proof of identity and proof of address
					such as PAN card / Unique Identification (UID) (Aadhaar)/ Passport/ Voter ID card/ Driving license,
					etc. KYC process may be done online through Aadhaar based E-KYC mechanism or offline by visiting or
					sending the documents to the registered address of the intermediary.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Online portal based Investor (Resident) E-KYC Process</b>
			<ol type="01">
				<li>Investor visits portal of SEBI registered intermediary to open account</li>
				<li>Investor enters the Aadhar number</li>
				<li>Investor will receive the OTP in mobile number registered with Aadhar. He enters the OTP in portal.
				</li>
				<li>E-KYC details from UIDAI will be displayed in the portal</li>
				<li>Investor needs to fill additional details as required under KYC format and submit</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			Once you have opened an account with a stock broker, you can buy or sell shares of a company through a stock
			broker of the recognized stock exchange where the shares are listed and traded. You can place order to buy
			or sell securities with your broker using the online trading account by visiting broker's website, mobile
			trading app of broker, through the phone using Call & Trade facility or physically visiting their office.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Modes of Placement of Order</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Mobile trading app</li>
				<li>Online trading account</li>
				<li>Physical order with broker</li>
				<li>Place orders on phone</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Trading days and Trading & Settlement Cycle</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Trading on the stock exchange takes place on all days of the week (except Saturdays and Sundays and
					holidays declared by the Stock Exchange in advance).
				</li>
				<li>
					In case of purchase of shares, investors are required to make payment to the bank account of your
					stock broker prior to the pay-in day for the relevant settlement. Once payment is made by the
					investor, the broker would credit the shares in the Demat account of investor after pay-out day.
				</li>
				<li>
					Similarly, in case of sale of shares, investors are required to deliver the shares to Demat account
					of broker prior to the pay-in day for the relevant settlement. Once the shares are delivered by the
					investor, the broker would credit the funds in the bank account of investor after pay-out day.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>What is the pay-in day and pay-out day?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Pay-in day is the day when the brokers shall make payment of funds (in case of purchase of shares)
					or delivery of securities (in case of sale of shares) to the stock exchange.
				</li>
				<li>
					Pay-out day is the day when the stock exchange makes payment of funds (in case of sale of shares) or
					delivery of securities (in case of purchase of shares) to the broker. Settlement cycle is on T+2
					rolling settlement basis w.e.f. April 01, 2003 (where T stands for the trade day). For example,
					trades executed on a Monday are typically settled on the following Wednesday (considering 2 working
					days from the trade day). The funds and securities pay-in and pay-out are carried out on T+2 day.
				</li>
				<li>
					The exchanges have to ensure that the pay-out of funds and securities to the clients is done by the
					broker within 24 hours of the pay-out.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Margin and Pledging / Re-pledging of securities</b>
			<br>When an investor buys a stock, he has two options, i.e.
			<ul>
				<li>
					to pay the entire price of the stock upfront, called early pay in or
				</li>
				<li>
					to pay only a certain percentage of the price of the stock and borrow money from the broker to
					finance the rest. The percentage of the price of the stock paid upfront is called margin. The
					payment of the remaining amount can be made by the designated pay-out time.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Similarly, when an investor desires to sell his stocks he has the option
			<ul>
				<li>
					to either pay in the shares to be sold or
				</li>
				<li>
					can give a margin upfront.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			Margin can be provided in the form of cash or instruments like fixed deposits, bank guarantee, securities,
			units of mutual funds, government securities and treasury bills in demat form.
		</li>
		<li>
			Margin is provided in the form of securities, in favour of the broker only in the form of pledge. A pledge
			is a deposit of some personal property as collateral for a debt. Stock Brokers can accept securities (viz
			shares) as collateral only in the form of margin pledge created on the securities held in client’s demat
			account. Investor (client) needs to give instructions to create margin pledge on securities. This
			instruction can be in physical form or electronically through “SPEED-e” (for NSDL) and “Easiest” (for CDSL).
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Contract Note</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A Contract Note is evidence of trade done by the stock broker given to the investor and is a legal
					document which contains details of the transaction such as securities bought/sold, traded price,
					time of trade, brokerage, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					Contract Notes can be issued in physical form or in electronic form. In case investor opts for
					electronic contract note, a specific authorization needs to be given to the stock broker along with
					the details of email of the investor.
				</li>
				<li>
					Such electronic contract notes shall be digitally signed and encrypted which would make them
					difficult to be tampered.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Basic Services Demat Account (BSDA)</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					SEBI with a view to achieve wider financial inclusion, encourage holding of demat accounts. In order
					to reduce the cost of maintaining securities in demat accounts for retail individual investors, SEBI
					has made available a Basic Services Demat Account" (BSDA) to investors.
				</li>
				<li>
					Benefits of BSDA
					<ul>
						<li>
							Nil/Low Annual Maintenance Charges (AMC)
						</li>
						<li>
							Free of charge periodic Transaction and Holding statements of the Demat account.
						</li>
						<li>
							2 physical statements free of charge during the billing cycle.
						</li>
						<li>
							At least 2 Delivery Instruction Slips (DIS) shall be issued at time of account opening.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Annual Maintenance Charges (AMC)</b><br>
					It refers to the charges collected by Depository Participants (DPs) towards maintenance of Demat
					accounts of the beneficiary owners (Account Holders), depending upon the value of holdings in the
					Demat account.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Mutual Fund</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A mutual fund pools in money from many investors and invests the money in stocks, bonds, short-term
					money-market instruments, other securities or assets, or some combination of these investments.
				</li>
				<li>
					All mutual funds are required to be registered with SEBI before they launch any scheme.
				</li>
				<li>
					Salient features of mutual funds are:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Professional management -</b>
							Money is invested through fund managers with proven expertise in the field of investment.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Diversification - </b>
							Diversification is an investing strategy that can be summed up as investing small amounts of
							your money in different investment options like different schemes of mutual funds and
							holding shares of multiple companies.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Economy of scale - </b>
							A mutual fund buys and sells large amount of securities at one go. This makes its
							transaction cost lower than what an individual would pay for securities transactions.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Liquidity - </b>
							Just like individual shares, mutual fund units can be converted into money through sale in
							the market or through redemption.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Simplicity - </b>
							Buying a mutual fund unit is simple and the minimum investment amount required is small.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Tax Benefits - </b>
							Different mutual fund categories are subjected to different tax treatments. It is important
							to understand the tax benefits of a fund before you invest in it.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Mutual funds are segregated in different categories based on the objectives of the mutual fund
					scheme. The schemes are designed to keep in mind the needs of various types of investors, risk
					averse investors (basically a conservative Investor who does not want to take high risk), moderate
					investors (investors who can take some amount of risk) and aggressive investors (investors who are
					willing to take risk in search of higher returns).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Categorization of Mutual Funds</b><br>
					Mutual funds are broadly categorized into five schemes mentioned as below:
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>Equity Schemes </b>
							Mutual funds which
							principally invest in stocks
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Debt Schemes </b>
							Mutual funds which
							principally invest in fixed
							income securities like bonds &
							treasury bills
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Hybrid Schemes </b>
							Mutual funds which invest in
							two or more asset classes
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Solution Oriented Schemes </b>
							Mutual fund schemes which
							make their investments as per
							the goals of individuals like
							retirement & child education
							planning, etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Other Schemes</b>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Product Labelling of Mutual Funds</b> <br>
					As per SEBI guidelines, mutual funds are to be labelled according to the level of risk involved and
					the same is to be depicted on the risk-o-meter. The different labels and risk-o-meter are mentioned
					as below:
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>Low: </b>
							Principal at
							low risk
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Low to
								Moderate: </b>
							Principal at
							moderately
							low risk
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Moderate: </b>
							Principal at
							moderate risk
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Moderately
								High: </b>
							Principal at
							moderately
							high risk
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>High: </b>
							Principal at high risk
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Very High: </b>
							Principal at
							very high
							risk
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>What is Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)?</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>
							An SIP or a Systematic Investment Plan allows an investor to invest a fixed amount of money
							regularly in a mutual fund scheme.
						</li>
						<li>
							It lets you set aside a fixed sum of money at regular intervals (weekly, monthly or
							quarterly) with an objective to gain capital appreciation in the longer run.
						</li>
						<li>
							SIP investment inculcates the habit of savings. Instead of trying to time the market, by
							investing on a regular basis, the investor benefits from the rupee-cost averaging factor.
						</li>
						<li>
							As the investments are done over different market cycles, the investor benefits from the
							market volatility by getting to buy more units of the same fund when the markets are low and
							buying less units when the prices are high.
						</li>
						<li>
							An investor can invest a pre-determined fixed amount as low as ₹500/- in a scheme every
							month or quarter, depending on his/her convenience through post-dated cheques, through
							Standing instruction (SI) facility or through ECS (Electronic Clearing Service) facility.
						</li>
						<li>
							Investors need to fill up an application form and SIP mandate form on which they need to
							indicate their choice for the SIP date (basically when the pre-determined amount will be
							invested). Subsequent SIPs may be auto-debited through a standing instruction, electronic
							clearing service or post-dated cheques.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Advantages of SIP</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Disciplined
							approach to
							investments</li>
						<li>No need to time
							the market</li>
						<li>Rupee Cost
							Averaging
							Benefit from</li>
						<li>Power of Compounding
							Small investments create
							Big Kitty over time</li>
						<li>Lighter on the
							wallet</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					In order to further ease out the investment procedure for the investors, Mutual Funds also offer the
					following options: <br>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Systematic Withdrawal Plans </b>
							Facility to withdraw fixed
							amounts from a particular
							scheme at regular intervals
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Systematic Transfer Plans </b>
							Facility to transfer funds
							from one scheme to
							another at regular intervals
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Commodity Derivatives Market</b><br><br>
			<b>What are commodities?</b><br>
			Commodities are goods with economic value. They are earth's natural products which are produced and traded.
			They are usually raw materials for further processing. The broad types of commodities are as under:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Agricultural commodities: </b>
					Food & non-food crops.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Non-Agricultural commodities: </b>
					Metals, Energy, Polymers, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Others: </b>
					cattle head, processed foods like juices, etc.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Major commodities are: <br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Edible oilseed </b>
					Groundnut, Mustard seed, Cottonseed, Soy oil, Crude Palm Oil etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Food grains </b>
					Wheat, Gram, Bajra (Pearl Millet), Maize, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Bullion </b>
					Gold, Silver
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Metals & Energy </b>
					Natural Gas, Crude Oil, Copper, Zinc, Aluminium, Lead, Nickel, Steel
					etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Spices </b>
					Turmeric, Pepper, Cumin seed, Cardamom etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Fibres </b>
					Cotton, Jute, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Others </b>
					Castor Seed, Guar seed (Cluster Bean), Guar gum, Rubber etc.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<b>What is Commodity Price Risk?</b><br>
			Commodity price risk is the price uncertainty that adversely impacts the financial position of those who
			both use and produce commodities. For example, as the price of steel rises, this increases the cost of
			automobile production and can negatively impact that producer's profit margins. Similarly, commodity price
			risk can equally impact producers of a commodity, not just users. If crop prices are low one year, a farmer
			may plant less of that crop. If prices subsequently rise next year, the farmer will miss out on a
			potentially profitable crop. This is called commodity price risk. The factors that can affect commodity
			prices include political and regulatory changes, seasonal variations, weather, technology and market
			conditions.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Risk Faced by Various Stakeholders</b><br>
			Various stakeholders face many risks in commodity trading, especially farmers, such as: <br>
			<ul>
				<li>Price volatility and price risk</li>
				<li>Lack of quality storage facilities</li>
				<li>Need for finance at the time of sowing of crops</li>
				<li>Dependence on local middlemen and agents for selling their crops</li>
				<li>Small farm holdings — no bargaining power</li>
				<li>Opaque/manipulated prices at Mandis</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<b>How to protect against price risk in commodities?</b><br>
			A producer of a commodity is at risk of prices moving lower. Conversely, a consumer of a commodity is at
			risk of prices moving higher. The producers and consumers of commodities can participate in the commodity
			derivatives exchange to protect against adverse price movements. The process of protecting against financial
			loss or price risk is called "Hedging''. A hedge will guarantee a consumer the supply of a required
			commodity at a set price and a producer the known price for commodity output.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Benefits of Commodity Derivative Exchange</b><br>
			Commodity derivative exchange offers following benefits to producers and consumers of commodities:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Price discovery: </b>Helps producers / sellers and consumers / buyers and also exporters &
					importers of a commodity to discover price for a future date and helps them take informed decision.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Price risk management: </b>Helps hedge price risk or insure against adverse price movement and
					locks-in profit margin.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<b>Commodity Derivative Exchanges</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A commodity derivative exchange is an organized, regulated market that facilitates the purchase and
					sale of contracts whose values are linked to the price of commodities (e.g., wheat, barley, crude
					oil, gold, etc.).
				</li>
				<li>
					Typically, the buyers of these contracts agree to accept delivery of a commodity at a price on a
					future date, and similarly, the sellers agree to deliver the commodity at a price on a future date.
				</li>
				<li>
					For example, in case of Agricultural commodities, Commodity Derivatives Exchange helps in reducing
					the price risk, both for the farmers (seller of crop) and the consumer (buyers of crop /food
					processors) by helping them decide a price today (i.e. at the time of sowing or at the time of
					harvesting of the crop) for the crop to be delivered in the future. The transaction in the exchange
					is done through commodity brokers. The settlement of contract to buy and sell is guaranteed by the
					commodity derivatives exchange.
				</li>
				<li>
					The trading rules and procedures of recognized Commodity Derivatives Exchanges and Commodity Brokers
					are regulated by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) — a statutory body established under
					SEBI Act, 1992. In India, major commodity derivative exchanges are as follows:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd (MCX) — </b>predominantly non-agricultural products
							like gold, silver, aluminium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc and energy products like crude oil
							and natural gas are traded on this exchange.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>National Commodity and Derivative Exchange (NCDEX) — </b>predominantly agricultural
							products like pulses, cereals, sugar, etc. are traded on this exchange.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			There are three types of contracts in commodity derivatives market. These are <b>Forward Contracts, Futures
				Contract</b> and <b>Options</b>. Forward contract is an agreement between two parties to sell or buy a
			certain commodity at a fixed price in the future. This contract hedges the risk for the buyer against price
			fluctuations and the seller can get a guaranteed price for his product at a specified date.
			<br><br>
			Forward contracts are traded over the counter, while futures contracts are traded on the commodity
			derivatives exchanges. Forward contracts can be privately negotiated. Futures contract have a standardized
			way of execution and the transaction is guaranteed by the clearing house of a recognized commodity
			derivative exchange which minimizes the risk of defaults on the settlement of transaction.
			<br><br>
			For example, if A has the machinery that produces 10 bales of cotton, he can secure an agreement with B to
			sell the bales at a certain price after a year irrespective of the price that is trending. This is called
			hedging the risk. "A" hedges the risk by securing the price and "B" transacts by pre-booking the price
			expecting that prices would go up in the near future which would benefit him. The payment and delivery of
			the asset is made on the future date termed as the delivery date. The buyer in the futures contract is known
			to hold a long position. The seller in the futures contracts is said to be having short position.
			<br><br>
			An options contract refers to the financial instrument which gives the buyer of the option the right but not
			the obligation to exercise the option at a predetermined date at a predetermined price. Options contracts
			are of two types as explained below:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Call Option: </b>
					Call option gives one the right to buy the underlying security
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Put Option: </b>
					Put option gives one the right to sell the underlying security
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>
			Investors are charged a premium when they buy an options contract. On expiry of the contract, generally the
			transaction is cash settled instead of actually buying/selling the underlying security unlike in the cash
			market. Hence, many investors find Futures & Options (F&O) cheaper to trade, however, it is riskier than the
			cash segment because F&O is time dependent and you cannot hold on to the contract till the desired time i.e.
			when the market is favourable to earn positive returns. On the expiry of the contract, even if you cash
			settle the contract instead of taking delivery, the change in value of the underlying will be either
			credited or debited to your account.

			<b>How does a farmer do trading in Commodity Derivatives Market?</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					To deal with the legal/ logistics/ quality requirements of Derivatives Markets farmers would have to
					form a society/ trust/ Farmers Producing Organization (FPO), etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					Collectively they would have to deposit their produce in the warehouse of the Exchange.
				</li>
				<li>
					Quality of the produce for the purpose of standardization to be assayed (checked / tested) by
					Exchange recognized assayers.
				</li>
				<li>
					Exchange would issue a warehouse receipt (Loans can be obtained from banks against these receipts).
					Exchanges assume responsibility for maintaining the quality of the product for a certain period of
					time.
				</li>
				<li>
					The depositors now have time to check the prices (on the exchange) at which they can profitably sell
					the produce.
				</li>
				<li>
					When the desired price is likely to be realized, the bid is placed at the exchange. Once the order
					matches with the purchaser's bid, the trade is concluded.
				</li>
				<li>
					Farmers have to give delivery on the Exchange platform.
				</li>
				<li>
					Funds are given to the farmers upon satisfactory delivery of the commodity.

					Thus, insurance is a promise of compensation for specific potential future losses in exchange for a
					periodic payment called premium. An entity which provides insurance is known as the insurer. A
					person who buys insurance is known as an insured or the policy holder. The insured receives a
					contract called the insurance policy which contains details like the conditions and circumstances

			income through annuity plan on retirement.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>National Pension System (NPS)</b><br>

			Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) is a statutory regulatory body established by an
			Act of Parliament of India with the charter to promote, develop and regulate pension sector in India.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Estate Planning</b><br>
			Estate planning refers to planning during one's lifetime, earmarking one's assets to beneficiaries,
			typically family members, loved ones and institutions, so that they can be used/ claimed after one's demise
			with ease, and without any significant cost. Making a "Will" is an essential part of estate planning.
			Following are the constituents of estate planning:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Will</b>
					It is a written legal declaration of desires to distribute assets of the deceased after his or her
					demise. This way one can transfer assets to loved ones, according to his or her preferences. By
					making a Will, one can avoid any feud among beneficiaries over distribution of assets. Making a Will
					is a simple process.
				</li>
			</ul>

		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Nomination</b><br>
			A nominee is a person who receives the right to have custody of the money on the death of the account
			holder. A nominee is only a custodian of the asset owner's money and doesn't have any ownership rights. In
			the absence of nomination, it could be expensive and time consuming for the legal heirs of the deceased to
			get their money. Is nomination mandatory in case of a Demat account as well? It is not mandatory but
			advisable; nomination alleviates the problems faced by legal heirs in case of death of account holder. One
			should always remember to fill in the nomination details while opening any account.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Power of Attorney</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Power of attorney is a legal document that allows another person to act on your behalf. It ensures
					that important matters are dealt with by someone you trust if you are unable to deal with them
					yourself.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you aren't able to personally accomplish a task, you may grant someone else — the power to do it
					for you. This permission can include things like accessing your bank accounts, selling a vehicle,
					purchasing property or getting a home loan. In fact, your power of attorney can grant your agent the
					authority to conduct nearly any type of Transaction you could conduct on your behalf.
				</li>
				<li>
					The person who grants power of attorney to an agent is called the principal, and the principal may
					use either a general power of attorney or special power of attorney to give power to his or her
					agent. (Agent means many people to whom the power is given by the principal to act on the behalf of
					the principal). A general power of attorney gives the agent power to accomplish anything the
					principal could do, whereas a special power of attorney gives the agent limited powers, such as the
					power to accomplish a specific transaction.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Procedure to transfer person's wealth and assets after his or her death</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					After the demise of an individual, his or her legal heirs have to approach various authorities (like
					banks, depositories, mutual fund companies and Insurance companies) with their claim on the deceased
					assets. They have to present the death certificate along with legal heir's certificate to these
					authorities to transfer the assets of the deceased in their name.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the deceased has made a Will, the assets and the wealth of the deceased will be distributed as
					per his or her Will. In the absence of a Will, the transfer will be made only to legal heirs.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 8 – Borrowing-Related Products</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Borrowing is an act of taking money and paying it back over a period. In meeting financial goals, in case
			the savings are inadequate, one resorts to borrowing. Borrowing provides the flexibility of repaying in
			small instalments over a period of time. Equated Monthly Instalments (EMI) is a very popuar mode of
			repayment of loan.
		</li>
		<li>
			Collateral is a property or other asset that a borrower offers as a security to the lender in exchange of
			availing the loan. If the borrower stops making the promised loan repayments, the lender can seize the
			assets financed and the collateral to cover its losses. A lender's claim to a borrower's collateral is
			called a lien.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Different Type of Loans Available</b><br>
			The banking institutions provide various types of loans to individuals and business community such as:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Personal Loan</b><br>
					This loan can be utilized for any purpose, for example, paying debt, marriage expenses or vacation
					expenditure. No collateral security is required for this type of loan.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Vehicle Loan</b><br>
					This loan is issued for the purpose of purchasing new or second-hand vehicles for personal and
					commercial uses.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Education Loan</b><br>
					Education loan is required for students and family to meet the financial goal of higher education.
					<br>
					Students should have an admission offer from an institution before they apply for education loan.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Gold Loan</b><br>
					Gold loan is given only on providing gold as a security to a bank or any other lending institution.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Housing Loan</b><br>
					Housing Loans are taken by people for a variety of house-related purposes such as construction of a
					house, house renovation, extension of house, buying of property or land, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Agriculture Loan</b><br>
					Agriculture Loans are provided to farmers to fund agricultural operations or related activities like
					horticulture, sericulture, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Consumer Durable Loans</b><br>

					television, refrigerator, etc.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>5 Cs in Credit — One Stop Guide to get your Loan Sanctioned</b><br>
			The banks generally follow a conservative approach for processing the loan request of the borrowers. In this
			analysis, banks consider five elements and these are known as 5 Cs in credit. These are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Capacity: </b>The prospective lender will want to know exactly how you intend to and what is your
					capacity to repay the loan.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Character: </b>Lender will form a subjective opinion as to whether or not you are sufficiently
					trustworthy to repay the loan or generate a return on funds invested in your company.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Capital: </b>Capital is the money you personally have invested in the business and is an
					indication of how much you have at risk, should the business fail.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Collateral: </b>Banks insist on taking a security in addition to that is created out of loan
					proceeds.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Conditions: </b>Banks analyse the intended purpose of availing the loan like will the money be
					used for working capital, additional equipment or inventory, among others.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Credit Score</b><br>
			Credit information agencies play a vital role in decision making in loan application process. After an
			applicant fills out the application form and hands it over to the lender, the lender first checks the credit
			score and credit report of the applicant. If the credit score is low, the lender may not even consider the
			application further and reject it at that point. If the credit score is high, the lender will look into the
			application and consider other details to determine if the applicant is credit-worthy. The credit score
			works as a first impression for the lender, the higher the score, the better are your chances of the loan
			being reviewed and approved. The decision to lend is solely dependent on the lender and credit score or
			credit report does not in any manner decide if the loan or credit card should be sanctioned or not.
			<br>
			Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd (CIBIL) is India's first credit information company, also commonly
			referred as a credit bureau. CIBIL collects and maintains records of individuals' and non-individuals'
			(commercial entities) payments pertaining to loans and credit cards. These records are submitted to CIBIL by
			banks and other lenders on a monthly basis; using this information a Credit Information Report (CIR) and
			credit score is developed, enabling lenders to evaluate and approve loan applications. A credit bureau is
			licensed by the RBI and governed by the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act of 2005. The Reserve
			Bank of India requires all credit bureaus to give one free full credit report, every year, to all consumers.

			<b><u>Securities Market</u></b>
			<ol type="1">
				<li>
					<b>Primary Market</b>
					<ol type="i">
						<li>Objective: To raise funds</li>

						<li>Includes the further trading
							Of securities already offered
							To the public.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 3: Primary Market and Secondary Market</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Primary Market:</b> This market is also called as the new issues market where company / institutions
			raise funds (capital) from public by issuing new securities (shares, debentures, bonds, etc.).
			<br>
			There are two major types of issuers of securities:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Corporate Entities (companies) which mainly issue equity instruments (shares) and debt
					instruments (bonds, debentures, etc.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Government (Central as well as State) which issues debt securities (dated securities and
					treasury bills).
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			The types of issues made in Primary Market are:
			<ol type="1">
				<li>
					<b>Public Issue</b><br>
					Securities are issued to general public and anyone can
					subscribe to them. Public issue of equity shares can be
					categorized as follows:
					<ol type="i">
						<li>
							<b>Initial Public Offer (IPO):</b><br>
							An IPO is where first public offer of shares is made by a company. An IPO can be in the
							following forms:
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>Fresh Issue of shares</b> where new shares are issued by the company to the
									public investors. In
									this kind of an issue, the funds of investors will go to the company to be used for
									the purpose for
									which the issue is made.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Offer for Sale</b> where existing shareholders such as promoters or financial
									institutions or any
									other person offer their holding to the public. In this kind of an issue, the funds
									of the investors will
									go to such sellers of the shares and not to the company.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Follow on Public Offer (FPO):</b><br>
							It is made by an issuer/ company that has already done an IPO in the past and is making a
							fresh issue of securities to the public.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Preferential Issue</b><br>
					In this mode of issue, securities are issued to an identified set
					of investors like promoters, strategic investors, employees, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rights Issue</b><br>
					When the Company gives its existing shareholders the right to
					subscribe to newly issued shares, in proportion to their existing
					shareholding, it is called a rights issue.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Bonus Issue</b><br>
					When the existing shareholders of a company are issued
					additional shares, in proportion to their existing shareholding
					and without any additional cost, then it is called a bonus
					issue.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			In order to raise funds from public, companies need to file an offer document with SEBI which is
			called as the <b>draft red herring prospectus or the draft prospectus</b>. The prospectus contains details
			like the history of the company, details of the promoters, business model, financial history of the
			company, risks in that business, purpose for which the money is being raised, terms of issue and
			such other information that will help an investor to make an informed decision on investment in
			the shares of that company.
		</li>
		<li>
			The securities which are issued in primary market are listed on a
			recognized Stock Exchange in less than six (06) working days from the date of the closure of the
			issue. The shares are then listed on the recognized stock exchanges, where further trading of the
			shares takes place.
		</li>
		<li>
			The shares allotted by the company are credited in the
			Demat account of the investor which is maintained with a
			Depository through a SEBI registered Depository
			Participant (DP).
		</li>
		<li>
			An investor can sell the shares on the
			stock exchanges through a SEBI registered Stock broker
			and receive the money.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Secondary market: </b>
			Once the securities are issued in the primary market, they get listed on the
			Stock Exchanges and the investors can buy or sell these listed securities through those Stock
			Exchanges. Stock Exchanges have two main segments - Cash Market segment and the Derivatives
			Market segment.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 4: Who are the Market Infrastructure Institutions and Market
		Intermediaries in the securities market?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Market Infrastructure Institutions: </b>
			The infrastructure to
			facilitate the transactions in securities market (viz. issue,
			purchase and sale of securities) is provided by Stock
			Exchanges, Depositories and Clearing Corporations.
			These institutions are known as Market Infrastructure
			Institutions (MIIs). A list of SEBI registered market
			infrastructure institutions (MIIs) is available on the link:
			https://www.sebi.gov.in/intermediaries.html.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>The Stock Exchanges</b> provide a nation-wide computerized
			screen based trading platform to facilitate buying and
			selling of securities, through their registered stock
			brokers and at market determined prices, in a fair
			manner. The list of SEBI recognized stock exchanges in
			India is available on the link:
			https://www.sebi.gov.in/stock-exchanges.html.
		</li>
		<li>
			The major nation-wide stock exchanges are BSE Limited
			(BSE), National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE)
			and Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India Limited (MSE).
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Clearing Corporations:</b> The main function of Clearing
			Corporations is to guarantee the settlement of trades
			executed on the Stock Exchanges. In other words,
			Clearing corporations guarantee that every buyer will get
			the securities which are bought by him and every seller of
			securities will get money for the securities sold by him.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Depositories:</b> Depositories are institutions that hold
			securities of investors in dematerialized / electronic form
			and provide demat services to the investors through their
			Depository Participants (DP). There are two depositories
			in our country namely, National Securities Depository
			Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India)
			Limited (CDSL). Under each Depository, there are
			registered Depository Participants (DPs) (like branches of
			banks), which provide various services to the investors
			like opening and maintaining of a Demat account,
			dematerialization of shares, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Market Intermediaries</b> are important participants in the
			smooth functioning of the primary and the secondary
			markets. These market intermediaries support the
			process of executing orders for buying or selling of
			securities, dealing in securities and providing information
			relevant to the trading of securities. Some important
			intermediaries are stock brokers, depository participants,
			merchant bankers, share and transfer agents, registrars,
			etc. All such intermediaries are registered with SEBI and
			are required to abide by the prescribed norms to protect
			the investors. A list of SEBI recognized market
			intermediaries may be accessed on the following link:
			https://www.sebi.gov.in.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Basics of Investing</h4><br>
			Before you start investing in securities market, you need
			to understand and identify your investment goals,
			objectives and risk appetite (the extent up to which you
			are willing to take risk). Every investment decision should
			reflect your needs and requirements and should be as
			per your desired preferences. For example, whether you
			are willing to invest in safe products which give steady
			returns or if you want to take slightly higher risk and invest
			in products which may give you higher returns. Every
			investment comes with the risk of change in the inherent
			value of that investment. For example, investment in
			shares of automobile industry will attract the risk
			attached with the automobile industry (sales may go up or
			down or one brand of cars may be sold more than other
			brand, etc.)
			<br>
			Once you have decided your goals and identified your risk
			appetite, please decide the amount you want to invest
			and the time period over which you want to invest. The
			ability to take risk differs from investor to investor and
			could be dependent on the goals as well as the age of the
			investor.
			<br>
			The investors should also be well informed about their
			rights, responsibilities, Do’s and Don’ts of investing and
			these documents are available on the website/s of SEBI
			and stock exchanges and depositories. The Do’s and
			Don’ts of investing in securities market are also attached
			in the Annexure-I of this booklet. In addition to the same,
			the rights and obligations of investors are attached in the
			Annexure-II of this booklet.
			<br>
			Investors should make informed decision before investing
			in the shares of a company. They should carefully read all
			the information related to the company such as
			disclosures related to the company, its promoters, the
			project details, financial details, etc. These details can be
			found on the websites of the stock exchanges.
			<br>
			For investing in securities market, investors may also
			approach any SEBI registered Investment Adviser. A list of
			SEBI registered Investment Adviser(s) may be found on
			the following link:

	<h3>Chapter 6: How to Mitigate the Risks?</h3>
	<ul>
		The investors can try to mitigate risk by different means. Asset allocation is one strategy through
		which an investor can mitigate risk by diversifying their investments into various companies and

	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 7: Account Opening Process</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Pre-requisites for Investing in Securities Market</b><br>
			In order to invest in equity shares, an investor needs to open three accounts namely:
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					<b>Bank account</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Trading account or broking account</b> with a SEBI registered stock broker of a recognized Stock
					Exchange. This account is used to buy and sell securities on the Stock Exchanges. To open a
					trading account, you have to fill ACCOUNT OPENING FORM and submit the signed Know Your Client
					(KYC) documents.					
				</li>
				<li><b>Demat Account</b></li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			Take the following precautions while filling up the account opening form:
			<ul>
				<li>
					You should put your signatures while indicating preferences for trading in different
					exchanges.
				</li>
				<li>
					You should carefully note all the charges/ fees/ brokerage that are applicable on your
					accounts and keep a record of the same.
				</li>
				<li>
					Identify the segments in which you would like to trade (cash, F&O, Currency Derivative or
					any other segments). Trading in derivatives requires understanding of the derivative
					products.
				</li>
				<li>
					In case you want to avail additional facilities namely Running Account facility, execution of
					Power of Attorney, etc., you will have to give specific authorization to the stock broker in
					order to avoid any dispute in the future.
				</li>
				<li>
					You should provide your email address and mobile number in the account opening form.
					The broker and stock exchanges use these contact details to keep you updated on the
					trading updates that are important for you to know.
				</li>
				<li>
					You should always demand and take a copy of the account opening form for your records.					
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 8: Procedure for opening an account: Know Your Client (KYC) process</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			While opening of Demat/ Trading/ Bank Account, you have to submit Know Your Client (KYC)
			documents.			
		</li>
		<li>
			KYC is mandatory under the Prevention of Money
			Laundering Act, 2002 and Rules framed thereunder.
			While opening of Demat / Trading/ Bank account, client
			have to submit Officially Valid Documents (OVDs) as
			proof of identity and proof of address and these
			documents form a part of the KYC requirements.			
		</li>
		<li>
			An investor can establish his identity and address through
			relevant supporting prescribed documents such as PAN
			card / UIDAI-Aadhar/ Passport/ Voter ID card/ Driving
			license, etc.			
		</li>
		<li>
			Once the KYC form is submitted, a unique
			KYC Identification Number (KIN) is generated and
			communicated to the client by SMS/ Email. KYC is a
			one-time process and is valid across all the
			intermediaries. You need not undergo the same process
			again while opening an account with another
			intermediary in securities market.			
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>e-KYC</b><br>
			Investors can complete KYC process using e-KYC facility using UIDAI - Aadhaar/ Digi Locker.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Fill the account opening details/ form online in the Stock Broker’s website.
				</li>
				<li>
					Submit scanned images of the mandatory documents/POA (Proof of address) /
				</li>
				<li>
					POI(Proof of Identity).
				</li>
				<li>
					Complete IPV (In Person Verification) process over video call.
				</li>
				<li>
					Digitally Sign the document.
				</li>
				<li>
					Account gets activated.	
				</li>
			</ul>
					
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 9: Basic Services Demat Account (BSDA)</h3>
	<h4>Basic Services Demat Account (BSDA):</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Basic Services Demat Account is the demat account facility which is provided to individuals who
			have only one demat account (across all depositories) and the value of the holdings doesn’t
			exceed Rs.2 lakhs each for non-debt securities (like equities) and debt securities, at any point of
			time.			
		</li>
		<li>
			The Annual Maintenance charges (AMC) structure for BSDA is as mentioned below:
			<table class="td_bsda">
				<tr>
					<td class="td_bsda">Security Type</td>
					<td class="td_bsda">Slabs Value of Holdings</td>
					<td class="td_bsda">Charges</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="td_bsda">For Non-Debt Securities</td>
					<td class="td_bsda">Up to Rs. 50,000/-</td>
					<td class="td_bsda">No AMC</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="td_bsda">For Non-Debt Securities</td>
					<td class="td_bsda">Rs. 50,001 to Rs. 2,00,000/-</td>
					<td class="td_bsda">Up to Rs. 100/-</td>

					<td class="td_bsda">Up to Rs. 100/-</td>
				</tr>
			</table>			
		</li>
		<li>
			A combination of the above mentioned three accounts (i.e. a bank account, a demat account and
			a trading account) is often referred to as the “3-in-1” account. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The investors may either open the
			above mentioned three accounts separately with different depository participant/ broker/
			institution or they may also approach a single depository participant/ broker / institution who
			provides the facility of opening of all the three accounts together.			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 10: Power of Attorney</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Power of Attorney is a document of high
			importance as it is capable of giving your rights
			and access over your accounts and money to
			somebody else. In securities market, a client may
			execute the power of attorney (PoA) in favour of
			the stock broker and/or depository participant to
			authorize them to operate his demat and bank
			account to facilitate the delivery of shares and
			pay-in/ pay-out of funds. 
		</li>
		<li>
			A specific Power of
			Attorney (PoA), as per the guidelines of SEBI, may
			be executed by the client in favour of the stock
			broker / depository participant.
		</li>
		<li>
			As per SEBI guidelines, it is not mandatory to sign and issue a power of attorney. Signing of Power
			of Attorney is purely optional and voluntary – if you find that signing power of attorney is useful for
			you, you may sign it. You can also revoke the Power of Attorney at any point of time.
		</li>
		<li>
			In case any transfer of shares is done by your stock broker in your account, for any reason other
			than those that are authorized by you under POA, you should immediately take up the matter with
			your stock broker. In case no response is received from them or you are not satisfied with the
			response, you should immediately take up the matter with the Depository/Exchange.			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 11: Nomination</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Nomination is a facility that enables an individual investor
			to nominate a person, who can claim the securities held
			by him/ her in their demat accounts or the redemption
			proceeds thereof (in respect of mutual fund units) in the
			event of death of the investor.			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 12: How do I invest in Securities Market?</h3>
	<h4>Investment through Primary Market</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			When an issuer company issues shares to the general
			public through public offer, you can apply for the shares
			by submitting the necessary application form. For
			issuance of securities, the issuer company has to follow
			certain rules, regulations, etc. Shares will be allotted as
			per the prescribed Rules & regulations. The shares
			allotted will be credited in the applicant’s Demat Account
			maintained with DP. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Allotment of securities will be made
			in demat form and investors have a choice of
			subsequently getting them converted to physical shares.
			On closure of public issue, within six (06) working days of
			closure of the issue, shares allotted are listed on the
			recognized Stock Exchanges where further trading of the
			shares takes place.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Please Note:</b><br>
			As per latest SEBI guidelines, you can opt to hold securities such as share certificates in
			physical form or Demat form. However, with effect from April 01, 2019, securities can be
			transferred only if the same are held in Demat form. It is therefore advisable to open a demat
			account and hold all the securities in demat form. This rule is not applicable if the shares are
			to be transmitted to their legal heirs by way of inheritance or succession.			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 13: Process of investing in Primary Market</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			You can buy shares of a Company directly from
			the company during the public offer/ issue by
			filling up an application form and making
			payment during the period when the public issue
			is open for issue to the public. 
		</li>
		<li>
			In the application form, you have to fill your details such as name,
			address, number of shares applied for, bank
			account details, demat account in which shares
			are to be credited, etc.			
		</li>
		<li>
			Investors who are interested in investing in that
			IPO may then apply for the same through
			Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA)
			and also by using Unified Payment Interface (UPI)
			as a payment mechanism (mentioned later in the
			booklet in detail). 
		</li>
		<li>
			Investors will then have to fill up the application form and apply for allocation
			of shares to them as per their preference. The
			money for the shares for which the investor has
			applied, then gets blocked in the bank account of
			the investor. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The entire process of listing of an
			IPO takes six (06) working days after the closure
			of the issue. The investors to whom the shares
			are issued, get the shares in their demat account
			and the funds for the same get debited from their
			bank account. 
		</li>
		<li>
			In case the shares aren’t
			allocated, the funds blocked in the applicant
			investor’s bank account gets released for further
			utilization.			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 14: Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Investors can now apply for securities in IPOs
			through ASBA. In ASBA, money to the extent of
			price of the shares for which the investor has
			applied, is blocked, but it remains in your
			account till allotment. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Upon allotment of shares,
			etc., requisite amount is debited from your
			account. Blocked amount continues to earn
			interest and there is no requirement of refund in
			case of non-allotment. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Thus, instead of actually sending a cheque for applying in IPOs you can
			now apply through Application Supported by
			Blocked Amount (ASBA) which is facilitated by
			certain branches of collecting banks. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Investors can now invest in IPOs by using Unified
			Payment Interface (UPI) as a payment
			mechanism.			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 15: Investment through Secondary Market</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Once you have opened a trading/ broking
			account with a stock broker of a recognized Stock
			Exchange, you can buy or sell shares of a
			company through the stock broker at the stock
			exchange. 
		</li>
		<li>
			You can place the order for purchase
			or sale of securities through your broker using the
			online trading account by visiting broker’s
			website, mobile trading app of broker, through
			the phone using Call & Trade facility, by physically
			visiting the broker’s office or through Authorized
			Persons of stock brokers.

	<h3>Chapter 16: Trading days and Trading & Settlement Cycle</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Trading on the Stock Exchanges takes place on
			all days of the week (except Saturdays, Sundays
			and holidays declared by the Stock Exchanges).
		</li>
		<li>
			In case of purchase of shares, you are required to
			make payment to the bank account of your stock
			broker prior to the pay-in day for the relevant
			settlement (preferably immediately after
			receiving confirmation from the broker that your
			purchase order is successfully executed).
		</li>
		<li>	
			Similarly, in case of sale of shares, you are
			required to deliver the shares to the demat
			account of broker prior to the pay-in day for the
			relevant settlement.			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>What is the pay-in day and pay-out day?</h4><br>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Pay-in day is the day when the brokers shall make
			payment or delivery of securities to the clearing corporation of the exchange. Pay-out day is the day
			when the clearing corporation makes payment or delivery of securities to the broker. Settlement
			cycle is on a T+2 rolling settlement basis w.e.f. April 01, 2003 (where T stands for the trade day).
			For example, the trades executed on a Monday are typically settled on the following Wednesday
			(considering 2 working days from the trade day). Stock Exchanges ensure that the pay-in and
			pay-out of funds and securities are carried out on T+2 day.			
		</li>
		<li>
			Pay-in of funds/ securities refers to the transfer of funds/
			securities from brokers account to the exchange’s account.
		</li>
		<li>
			Pay-out: Pay-out of funds/securities refers to transfer of
			funds/securities from Exchange account to Broker account.

			Contract Note is an evidence of the trade done
			by the stock broker. It is a legal document which
			contains details of the transaction such as
			securities bought/ sold, traded price, time of
			trade, brokerage, etc. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Contract Notes can be
			issued in physical form or in electronic form. In
			case you opt for an electronic contract note, a
			specific authorization needs to be given to the
			stock broker along with the details of your email
			ID. Such electronic contract notes shall be
			digitally signed, encrypted and can’t be
			tampered. Such contract notes should be preserved by the investor for future references. These have huge importance, especially if any
			dispute arises later.			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Record of client order:</h4><br>
	Stock brokers are required to execute trades of clients only after
	keeping evidence of the client placing such order, which could
	be, inter alia, in the form of:	
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Physical record written and signed by client,</li>
		<li>Telephone recording,</li>
		<li>Email from authorized email ID,</li>
		<li>Log for internet transactions,</li>
		<li>Record of messages through mobile phones,</li>
		<li>Any other legally verifiable record.</li>
	</ol>	
	<h4>Chapter 18: SMS and Email Alerts to Investors</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Investors can opt for SMS and email alerts facility
			through which they shall receive free of cost SMS
			and email alerts for any trading/ transaction
			activity that would happen in their trading and
			demat account. 
		</li>
		<li>
			In order to avail this facility,
			investors should ensure that their mobile
			numbers and email IDs are shared and regularly
			updated with their stock brokers and depository
			participants.

	<ul>
		<li>
			In normal course, settlement of a transaction
			(buy/sell) by a broker has to be done within 24
			hours of pay-out of funds / securities. However, if
			you regularly trade in shares on the stock
			exchange, you may specifically authorize the
			stock broker to maintain a Running Account
			whereby your shares or funds, as the case may
			be, would be kept in a separate account with the
			stock broker.
		</li>
		<li>
			Running Account facilitates ease of carrying out
			transactions in securities whereby the shares or
			funds kept in the running account with the stock
			broker are adjusted towards the settlement
			obligations of the future transactions.
		</li>
		<li>
			Running Account authorization is voluntary and useful for the investors who frequently buy
			and sell securities. Running Account authorization shall be dated and revocable at any time.
			The actual settlement of the funds and securities shall be done by the broker, at least once in
			30 days / 90 days as opted by the investors (client).			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 20: Trade Verification</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>

			exchanges is a very simple tool to verify the
			trades executed in your account. The data on the
			trades would be available on T+1 day.			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 21: What is Margin money?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The margin money is prescribed by exchanges /
			Clearing Corporations and collected from
			investors by brokers before executing a trade on
			their behalf. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The margin money is collected to
			mitigate the risk of non- payment of funds for buy
			trades or non-delivery of securities for sell trades
			by an investor. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Margin can be provided in the form
			of cash or securities or cash equivalent i.e. fixed
			deposits, bank guarantee, units of mutual funds,
			government securities, and treasury bills in
			demat form etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			With effect from September 01, 2020 investors (client) can provide margin in the form of
			“securities” only by pledging the securities in favour of specially designated demat account of
			stock broker.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Early Pay-in:</b> In case investor wants to avail exemption from payment of margin, investor may use
			“early pay-in” facility where payment of funds / delivery of shares shall be made to the broker
			before the pay-in date or as per time/date specified by the broker.

			single/ combined account statement which
			shows the details of transactions made by an
			investor during a month across all Mutual Funds

	<ul>
		<li>
			Derivatives refers to the financial instruments
			which derive their value from an underlying
			security or financial instrument. The underlying
			products can be equity, commodity, currency, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			Derivatives are primarily used by investors for
			hedging their position and minimizing the price
			risk. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Hedging is basically a risk management
			strategy in which the investors invest in the
			instruments strategically to offset the risk of any
			adverse price movements.
		</li>
		<li>
			The players in derivatives may be hedgers, speculators and arbitrageurs and different roles may
			be played in different situations.
		</li>
		<li>
			Futures and Options, or commonly called as F&O segment, are an essential part of the derivatives
			segment of the securities market. Futures and options are two different types of derivatives.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Futures contract</b><br>
			A futures contract is a standardized exchange traded contract to buy or sell an underlying product
			at a predetermined price on a future date.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Options Contract</b><br>
			An options contract refers to the financial instrument which gives the buyer of the option the right
			but not the obligation to exercise the option at a pre-determined date and price. 
			<br>
			A call option gives one the right to buy the underlying security and 
			<br>
			a put option gives one the right to sell the underlying security. 
			<br>
			Investors are charged a premium when they buy an options contract.			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 25: Mutual Funds</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A mutual fund pools in money from many
			investors and invests the money in stocks,
			bonds, short-term money-market instruments,
			other securities or assets, or some combination
			of these investments. 
		</li>
		<li>
			All mutual funds are required to be registered with SEBI before they
			launch any scheme. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Mutual funds can also be
			segregated in different categories based on the
			objectives of the mutual fund scheme. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The schemes are designed to keep in mind the needs
			of various types of investors - risk averse
			investors (basically a conservative Investor who
			does not want to take high risk), moderate
			investors (investors who can take some amount
			of risk) and aggressive investors (investors who
			are willing to take higher risk in search of higher
			returns).			
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Categorization of mutual funds: Mutual funds are now broadly categorized into five types of schemes
		mentioned as below:</h4>
	<ol type="A">
		<li>
			<b>Equity Schemes:</b> Mutual funds which principally invest in stocks/ equities.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Debt Schemes:</b> Mutual funds which principally invest in fixed income securities like
			bonds and treasury bills.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Hybrid Schemes:</b> Mutual funds which invest in two or more asset classes such as
			equities, fixed income, cash, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Solution Oriented Schemes:</b> Mutual fund schemes which make their investments as
			per the goals of individuals like retirement and child planning, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Other Schemes:</b> All other schemes like Index Funds, Sectoral funds, etc.			
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Chapter 26: How to invest in Mutual Funds?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Mutual funds normally come out with an advertisement in newspapers publishing the date of
			launch of the new schemes. Investors can also contact the agents and distributors of mutual funds
			who are spread all over the country for necessary information and application forms. 
		</li>
		<li>
			While investing in mutual funds, the investors will first have to complete their KYC process. An investor
			can either do a physical KYC at the branch of the fund or at the registrar office. Alternatively, an
			individual can also do e-KYC using his Aadhaar card and his PAN card number.
		</li>
		<li>
			Once the KYC process is complete, the investor then has to decide upon the scheme that he wants
			to invest in. This decision is based on the risk appetite and financial goals. When the investor has
			shortlisted the mutual fund scheme, he will have to fill up the necessary application forms for
			investing in those respective schemes. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Forms can be deposited with mutual funds through the
			agents and distributors who provide such services or directly with the MF. While filling up the
			application form, an investor must mention clearly his name, address, number of units applied for
			and such other information as required in the application form. 
		</li>
		<li>
			He must give his bank account
			number so as to avoid any fraudulent encashment of any cheque/ draft issued by the mutual fund
			at a later date for the purpose of dividend or repurchase. Any changes in the address, bank
			account number, etc. at a later date should be informed to the mutual fund immediately. 
		</li>
		<li>
			In order to further ease out the investment procedure for the investors, Mutual Funds offer the following
			options in addition to the lumpsum investment:	
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Systematic Investment Plans:</b> Facility to invest fixed amounts in a particular
					scheme at regular intervals.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Systematic Withdrawal Plans:</b> Facility to withdraw fixed amounts from a particular
					scheme at regular intervals.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Systematic Transfer Plans:</b> Facility to transfer funds from one scheme to another at
					regular intervals.
				</li>
			</ul>		
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Chapter 27: Product Labelling of Mutual Funds</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			As per SEBI guidelines, mutual fund schemes are to be labelled
			according to the level of risk involved and the same is to be
			depicted on the risk-o-meter. The risk-o-meter with different
			labels of risk is depicted as below:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Low: Principal at low risk</li>
				<li>Low to Moderate: Principal at moderately low risk</li>
				<li>Moderate: Principal at moderate risk</li>
				<li>Moderately High: Principal at moderately high risk</li>
				<li>High: Principal at high risk</li>
