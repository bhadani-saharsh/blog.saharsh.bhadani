	<h2>Definition:</h2><br>
	"Robotics, design, construction, and use of machines (robots) to perform tasks done traditionally by 
	human beings. Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple 
	repetitive tasks, and in industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans" 
	(Britannica, 2024).

	<h2>Components of Robotics:</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Mechanical Components: </b>strength of material, tensile strength of material, shape and structure 
		of components, strength and payload handeling capabilities of hinges, the physics and chemistry of 
		materials and the surrounding environment. 
		<br><br>
		<b>Electrical Components: </b>capacity of electrical components such as motors, wires, batteries, sensors, 
		etc. Intercompability of components. 
		<br><br>
		<b>Software: </b>The brain of robot. The decision making capability of a robot is because of the underlying 
		software. As the robot becomes more and more autonomous the role of software becomes more and more important. 
		<br><br>
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Market-size of robotics:</h2>
	<p>
		The usage of robotics is increasing day by day. At present, this industry is valued at USD 45.85 Billion. 
		This industry is expected to become USD 95.93 Billion by 2029. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<hr>
	<h2>Types of robots:</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs): </b>uses sophisticated sensors, artificial intelligence, and machine 
		learning. Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) can support many tasks, including delivering items, carrying out 
		safety and security checks, inventory automation, rescue missions, crop harvesting, and even space 
		exploration.<br><br>
		<b>Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs): </b>It is a form of autonomous mobile robots, automated guided 
		vehicles (AGVs) are movable robots capable of navigating mapped routes via wires on a floor, radio waves, 
		cameras, magnets, or lasers. These robots have several applications, including transporting heavy materials 
		in factories and warehouses.<br><br>
		<b>Articulated Robots: </b>One of the main features of an articulated robot is rotary joints that can 
		range from simple two-jointed structures to complex systems of multiple interacting joints and materials. 
		The articulated robot is a typical type of industrial robot and often resembles a human arm.<br><br>
		<b>Humanoids: </b>A humanoid robot resembles a generic human body form. The specialized design is 
		typically used for mimicking human motions and interactions. A common use case of humanoid robots is 
		automating tasks to increase efficiency and cost-savings.<br><br>
		<b>Cobots: </b>A cobot is a contracted term for a collaborative robot. These robots work side-by-side 
		with human workers. They differ from other robots because their function is not intended to do work in 
		place of human employees. Often they are compact and perform a variety of tasks in the metal industry, 
		automotive, electronics, laboratories, and hospitals.<br><br>	
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Basic Principles Behind Robotics: </h2>
	<p>
		<b>Cybernetics: </b>It is a field of systems theory that studies circular causal systems whose outputs 
		are also inputs, such as feedback systems. It is concerned with the general principles of circular 
		causal processes, including in ecological, technological, biological, cognitive and social systems and 
		also in the context of practical activities such as designing, learning, and managing.<br>

					pressure, and most importantly, captured information and past information. It was defined
